# Abstract

## Research goals and why the work was worth doing

Artificial intelligence (AI) enabled clinical decision support systems (CDSS) may help clinicians diagnose diseases and forecast disease courses, select appropriate treatment regimens, and predict treatment outcomes [e.g., @davenport_kalakota19].
The use of AI tools has become widespread in some healthcare areas. 
For example, radiologists use AI recommendations to detect cancerous lumps [@vanleeuwen_etal21]. 
At the same time, healthcare practitioners often do not adopt available tools [e.g., @sendak_etal20] - due to a general reluctance to base decisions on algorithms, data privacy concerns, or the belief that these tools do not offer any benefits for their care [e.g., @shaw_etal19].

Based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology [UTAUT; @venkatesh_etal03; @venkatesh_etal16], the current meta-analysis examines the predictors and boundary conditions of the intention to use AI-enabled CDSS. 
Over the past years, the UTAUT has been applied extensively to study the acceptance and intention to use AI-enabled tools in healthcare [e.g., @fan_etal20; @tamori_etal22]. Despite the accumulation of research, we still lack a comprehensive overview and empirical integration of research findings on the antecedents of the intention to use AI-enabled CDSS among clinicians. 
The generated insight may provide means to ease the adoption of AI-enabled CDSS, thus enhancing efficiency and effectiveness in healthcare [@shaw_etal19].

## Theoretical background

The UTAUT provides a theoretical framework that explains the relationship between technology, environment, and user characteristics with the behavioral intention to use a technology. It includes four main predictors: a) performance expectancy (*does the tool enhance their performance?*), b) effort expectancy (*are they able to use the tool?*), c) social influence (*do others believe that the tool should be used?*), and d) facilitating conditions (*does the existing infrastructure support the use of the tool?*).
We additionally include variables as predictors that are not part of the original model but that have been used extensively in UTAUT-based research in the healthcare domain [e.g., trust and perceived knowledge; @arfi_etal21; @gado_etal22]. 
Finally, we conduct sub-group and moderation analyses that account for specific contextual (e.g., organization type, healthcare area) and individual (e.g., age, gender) boundary conditions of the relationship between UTAUT predictors and the intention to use AI-enabled CDSS. 

## Design and methodology 

We follow the PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews and meta-analyses [@page_etal21]. First, we search electronic databases (e.g., Web of Science, PsycInfo, and ProQuest) using the keywords "medicine", "utaut", and related terms. Second, we conduct forward searches in Google Scholar of studies citing @venkatesh_etal03. Third, we search abstracts of relevant conference proceedings. We exclude articles if they are not published in English, focus on tools that do not fall within the definition of AI-enabled CDSS, do not measure the intention to use or the actual use of AI-enable CDSS, or do not include predictor variables included in the UTAUT research model.
We meta-analytically assess the bivariate relationship between UTAUT predictors and outcomes. In addition, we conduct moderation analyses to evaluate the influencing effect of contextual (e.g., clinical context, healthcare domain) and individual (e.g., age, location) variables. 

## Expected results 

We expect the results to be available by mid-December 2022. 

## Limitations

Other theories, such as the framework of Nonadoption, Abandonment, and Challenges to the Scale-Up, Spread, and Sustainability (NASSS) of health and care technologies [@greenhalgh_etal17] may be helpful in understanding influencing factors embedded in the broader political, regulatory, and sociocultural system [@shaw_etal19]. 
In addition, we expect most of the studies included in the meta-analysis to use self-report measurements, possibly increasing the risk of common method bias [@podsakoff_etal03]. 

## Conclusions

By applying the UTAUT to the context of AI-enabled CDSS and considering individual and contextual boundary conditions, we counter some of the criticism regarding the overly simplistic approach of UTAUT research [@shachak_etal19]. A meta-analytic approach allows us to rigorously examine the value of applying the UTAUT to the context of AI-enabled CDSS and suggesting empirically-based modifications and extensions to the existing framework. The insight may be used in educational programs that aim at easing the adoption of AI tools, thus potentially increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of modern healthcare.

## Relevance to the congress theme

The future is now. The current meta-analysis contributes to acquiring urgently needed competencies among healthcare practitioners.
