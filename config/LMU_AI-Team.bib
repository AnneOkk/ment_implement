  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) offers robust statistical and probabilistic techniques that can help to make sense of large amounts of data. This scoping review paper aims to broadly explore the nature of research activity using ML in the context of psychological talk therapies, highlighting the scope of current methods and considerations for clinical practice and directions for future research. Using a systematic search methodology, fifty-one studies were identified. A narrative synthesis indicates two types of studies, those who developed and tested an ML model (k=44), and those who reported on the feasibility of a particular treatment tool that uses an ML algorithm (k=7). Most model development studies used supervised learning techniques to classify or predict labeled treatment process or outcome data, whereas others used unsupervised techniques to identify clusters in the unlabeled patient or treatment data. Overall, the current applications of ML in psychotherapy research demonstrated a range of possible benefits for indications of treatment process, adherence, therapist skills and treatment response prediction, as well as ways to accelerate research through automated behavioral or linguistic process coding. Given the novelty and potential of this research field, these proof-of-concept studies are encouraging, however, do not necessarily translate to improved clinical practice (yet).},

  abstract = {At the dawn of the fourth industrial revolution, we are witnessing a fast and widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in our daily life, which contributes to accelerating the shift towards a more algorithmic society. However, even with such unprecedented advancements, a key impediment to the use of AI-based systems is that they often lack transparency. Indeed, the black-box nature of these systems allows powerful predictions, but it cannot be directly explained. This issue has triggered a new debate on explainable AI (XAI). A research field holds substantial promise for improving trust and transparency of AI-based systems. It is recognized as the sine qua non for AI to continue making steady progress without disruption. This survey provides an entry point for interested researchers and practitioners to learn key aspects of the young and rapidly growing body of research related to XAI. Through the lens of the literature, we review the existing approaches regarding the topic, discuss trends surrounding its sphere, and present major research trajectories.},

As technology is advancing rapidly, it is critical to understand the current state of AI applications in DP. Therefore, a patent analysis of AI in DP is required to assess the application and publication trends, major assignees, and leaders in the field. We searched five major patent databases, namely, those of the USPTO, EPO, KIPO, JPO, and CNIPA, from 1974 to 2021, using keywords such as DP, AI, machine learning, and deep learning. We discovered 6284 patents, 523 of which were used for trend analyses on time series, international distribution, top assignees; word cloud analysis; and subject category analyses. Patent filing and publication have increased exponentially over the past five years. The United States has published the most patents, followed by China and South Korea (248, 117, and 48, respectively). The top assignees were Paige.AI, Inc. (New York City, NY, USA) and Siemens, Inc. (Munich, Germany) The primary areas were whole-slide imaging, segmentation, classification, and detection. Based on these findings, we expect a surge in DP and AI patent applications focusing on the digitalization of pathological images and AI technologies that support the vital role of pathologists.},

Besides, there is also a growing concern on the ethical aspect of e-money from an Islamic perspective, that is riba or usury. Previous studies have examined customers' behavioral intention to use e-money by implementing Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). However, none of them considering customers' knowledge about riba that might become ethical aspect detaining them to use e-money as the mode of payment. The objective of this research is to examine the moderating effect of knowledge about riba on Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) variabels, such as perceived usefuleness, perceived ease of use and intention to use e-money. Data of this research are collected by distributing online questionnaires. By convenience sampling method, there are total 253 respondents. From the statistical computation, it is found that intention to use e-money is significantly affected by respondents' perception of e-money usefulness and ease of use. Interestingly, it is also found that customers' intention to use e-money are moderated by their knowledge about riba. Therefore, as managerial implication, it is suggested for e-money providers to build a Muslim-friendly system that is free from riba. Finally, this research also suggests future research agenda to consider subjective norm and religiosity variabels in a single model.},

Developmental delay, mental health, and neurology conditions had the strongest associations (ORs 2.0–23.3). Moderately strong associations were observed for nutrition, genetic, ear nose and throat, and sleep conditions (ORs 2.1–3.2). Using machine learning methods, we clustered children based on their medical conditions prior to ASD diagnosis and demonstrated ASD risk stratification.

Despite negative effects on mothers’ and children’s health, many women do not receive adequate care. Preventive interventions are cost-efficient among high-risk women, but our ability to identify these is poor. We leveraged the power of clinical, demographic, and psychometric data to assess if machine learning methods can make accurate predictions of postpartum depression. Data were obtained from a population-based prospective cohort study in Uppsala, Sweden, collected between 2009 and 2018 (BASIC study, n\,=\,4313). Sub-analyses among women without previous depression were performed. The extremely randomized trees method provided robust performance with highest accuracy and well-balanced sensitivity and specificity (accuracy 73\%, sensitivity 72\%, specificity 75\%, positive predictive value 33\%, negative predictive value 94\%, area under the curve 81\%). Among women without earlier mental health issues, the accuracy was 64\%. The variables setting women at most risk for PPD were depression and anxiety during pregnancy, as well as variables related to resilience and personality. Future clinical models that could be implemented directly after delivery might consider including these variables in order to identify women at high risk for postpartum depression to facilitate individualized follow-up and cost-effectiveness.},

  abstract = {Individuals with serious mental illness experience changes in their clinical states over time that are difficult to assess and that result in increased disease burden and care utilization. It is not known if features derived from speech can serve as a transdiagnostic marker of these clinical states. This study evaluates the feasibility of collecting speech samples from people with serious mental illness and explores the potential utility for tracking changes in clinical state over time. Patients (n = 47) were recruited from a community-based mental health clinic with diagnoses of bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Patients used an interactive voice response system for at least 4 months to provide speech samples. Clinic providers (n = 13) reviewed responses and provided global assessment ratings. We computed features of speech and used machine learning to create models of outcome measures trained using either population data or an individual’s own data over time. The system was feasible to use, recording 1101 phone calls and 117 hours of speech. Most (92\%) of the patients agreed that it was easy to use. The individually-trained models demonstrated the highest correlation with provider ratings (rho = 0.78, p{$<$}0.001). Population-level models demonstrated statistically significant correlations with provider global assessment ratings (rho = 0.44, p{$<$}0.001), future provider ratings (rho = 0.33, p{$<$}0.05), BASIS-24 summary score, depression sub score, and self-harm sub score (rho = 0.25,0.25, and 0.28 respectively; p{$<$}0.05), and the SF-12 mental health sub score (rho = 0.25, p{$<$}0.05), but not with other BASIS-24 or SF-12 sub scores. This study brings together longitudinal collection of objective behavioral markers along with a transdiagnostic, personalized approach for tracking of mental health clinical state in a community-based clinical setting.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Behavioral interventions such as psychotherapy are leading, evidence-based practices for a variety of problems (e.g., substance abuse), but the evaluation of provider fidelity to behavioral interventions is limited by the need for human judgment. The current study evaluated the accuracy of statistical text classification in replicating human-based judgments of provider fidelity in one specific psychotherapy--motivational interviewing (MI). METHOD: Participants (n\,=\,148) came from five previously conducted randomized trials and were either primary care patients at a safety-net hospital or university students. To be eligible for the original studies, participants met criteria for either problematic drug or alcohol use. All participants received a type of brief motivational interview, an evidence-based intervention for alcohol and substance use disorders. The Motivational Interviewing Skills Code is a standard measure of MI provider fidelity based on human ratings that was used to evaluate all therapy sessions. A text classification approach called a labeled topic model was used to learn associations between human-based fidelity ratings and MI session transcripts. It was then used to generate codes for new sessions. The primary comparison was the accuracy of model-based codes with human-based codes. RESULTS: Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses of model-based codes showed reasonably strong sensitivity and specificity with those from human raters (range of area under ROC curve (AUC) scores: 0.62 - 0.81; average AUC: 0.72). Agreement with human raters was evaluated based on talk turns as well as code tallies for an entire session. Generated codes had higher reliability with human codes for session tallies and also varied strongly by individual code. CONCLUSION: To scale up the evaluation of behavioral interventions, technological solutions will be required. The current study demonstrated preliminary, encouraging findings regarding the utility of statistical text classification in bridging this methodological gap.},

Physicians also lack understanding of what AI implementation could represent.                                            Growing points                AI can ultimately prove beneficial in healthcare, but requires meticulous governance similar to the governance of physician conduct.                                            Areas timely for developing research                Regulatory guidelines are needed on how to safely implement and assess AI technology, alongside further research into the specific capabilities and limitations of its medical use.},

  abstract = {Linear mixed-effects models (LMEMs) have become increasingly prominent in psycholinguistics and related areas. However, many researchers do not seem to appreciate how random effects structures affect the generalizability of an analysis. Here, we argue that researchers using LMEMs for confirmatory hypothesis testing should minimally adhere to the standards that have been in place for many decades. Through theoretical arguments and Monte Carlo simulation, we show that LMEMs generalize best when they include the maximal random effects structure justified by the design. The generalization performance of LMEMs including data-driven random effects structures strongly depends upon modeling criteria and sample size, yielding reasonable results on moderately-sized samples when conservative criteria are used, but with little or no power advantage over maximal models. Finally, random-intercepts-only LMEMs used on within-subjects and/or within-items data from populations where subjects and/or items vary in their sensitivity to experimental manipulations always generalize worse than separate F₁and F₂tests, and in many cases, even worse than F₁alone. Maximal LMEMs should be the 'gold standard' for confirmatory hypothesis testing in psycholinguistics and beyond. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

Many benefits from technology have already been realised, along with the identification of many challenges. In this Review, we discuss some of the challenges to developing effective automation for psychiatry to optimise physician treatment of individual patients. Using the perspective of automation experts in other industries, three examples of automation in the delivery of routine care are reviewed: (1) effects of electronic medical records on the patient interview; (2) effects of complex systems integration on e-prescribing; and (3) use of clinical decision support to assist with clinical decision making. An increased understanding of the experience of automation from other sectors might allow for more effective deployment of technology in psychiatry.},

The sub-domains of AI, machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and associated statistical tools are getting more attention. Therefore, various machine learning models are being created to take advantage of the data available and accomplish tasks, such as automatic prediction, classification, clustering, segmentation and anomaly detection, etc. Tasks like classification need labeled data used to train the models to achieve a reliable accuracy. This study shows the systematic review of promising research areas and applications of DL models in medical diagnosis and medical healthcare systems. The prevalent DL models, their architectures, and related pros, cons are discussed to clarify their prospects. Many deep learning networks have been useful in the field of medical image processing for prognosis and diagnosis of life-threatening ailments (e.g., breast cancer, lung cancer, and brain tumor, etc.), which stand as an error-prone and tedious task for doctors and specialists when performed manually. Medical images are processed using these DL methods to solve various tasks like prediction, segmentation, and classification with accuracy bypassing human abilities. However, the current DL models have some limitations that encourage the researchers to seek further improvement.},

  abstract = {Background: The potential for machine learning to disrupt the medical profession is the subject of ongoing debate within biomedical informatics and related fields. Objective: This study aimed to explore general practitioners’ (GPs’) opinions about the potential impact of future technology on key tasks in primary care. Methods: In June 2018, we conducted a Web-based survey of 720 UK GPs’ opinions about the likelihood of future technology to fully replace GPs in performing 6 key primary care tasks, and, if respondents considered replacement for a particular task likely, to estimate how soon the technological capacity might emerge. This study involved qualitative descriptive analysis of written responses (“comments”) to an open-ended question in the survey. Results: Comments were classified into 3 major categories in relation to primary care: (1) limitations of future technology, (2) potential benefits of future technology, and (3) social and ethical concerns. Perceived limitations included the beliefs that communication and empathy are exclusively human competencies; many GPs also considered clinical reasoning and the ability to provide value-based care as necessitating physicians’ judgments. Perceived benefits of technology included expectations about improved efficiencies, in particular with respect to the reduction of administrative burdens on physicians. Social and ethical concerns encompassed multiple, divergent themes including the need to train more doctors to overcome workforce shortfalls and misgivings about the acceptability of future technology to patients. However, some GPs believed that the failure to adopt technological innovations could incur harms to both patients and physicians. Conclusions: This study presents timely information on physicians’ views about the scope of artificial intelligence (AI) in primary care. Overwhelmingly, GPs considered the potential of AI to be limited. These views differ from the predictions of biomedical informaticians. More extensive, stand-alone qualitative work would provide a more in-depth understanding of GPs’ views.},

Objective:                This mixed methods pilot study aimed to explore postgraduate clinical psychology students' familiarity and formal exposure to topics related to artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) during their studies.                                            Methods:                In April-June 2020, we conducted a mixed-methods online survey using a convenience sample of 120 clinical psychology students enrolled in a two-year Masters' program at a Swiss University.                                            Results:                In total 37 students responded (response rate: 37/120, 31\%). Among respondents, 73\% (                n                = 27) intended to enter a mental health profession, and 97\% reported that they had heard of the term “machine learning.” Students estimated 0.52\% of their program would be spent on AI/ML education. Around half (46\%) reported that they intended to learn about AI/ML as it pertained to mental health care. On 5-point Likert scale, students “moderately agreed” (median = 4) that AI/M should be part of clinical psychology/psychotherapy education. Qualitative analysis of students' comments resulted in four major themes on the impact of AI/ML on mental healthcare: (1) Changes in the quality and understanding of psychotherapy care; (2) Impact on patient-therapist interactions; (3) Impact on the psychotherapy profession; (4) Data management and ethical issues.                                            Conclusions:                This pilot study found that postgraduate clinical psychology students held a wide range of opinions but had limited formal education on how AI/ML-enabled tools might impact psychotherapy. The survey raises questions about how curricula could be enhanced to educate clinical psychology/psychotherapy trainees about the scope of AI/ML in mental healthcare.}

This article addresses the nascent research field of blockchain for a circular economy and examines current developments, from both research and practice. By developing and conducting a research-practice gap analysis using a systematic literature review, this article identifies patterns of interests and opportunities for research and practice and uncovers mutual blind spots that need to be addressed in either sphere. A systematic literature review and qualitative analysis covering 57 diverse documents (journal articles, contents linked from twitter, and google results) revealed three key findings: 1) a clear terminology of blockchain types, their technical properties and benefits are lacking in research, 2) trust and verification are major potential benefits but a challenge to create, and 3) a closer examination of possible benefits and challenges of blockchain technologies for the circular economy with its links to sustainable development is crucial.},

  abstract = {Purpose Job demands can contribute to nurses’ turnover intention and this can have an impact on health services among the general population. It appears important to identify the work environment factors associated with turnover intention, as well as the psychological resources liable to act on this relationship. Drawing on self-determination theory (SDT), the purpose of this study (n=1179) is to investigate the relationship between two job demands (role ambiguity and role conflict) and turnover intention, as well as the moderating role of basic need satisfaction (autonomy, competence and relatedness) within these relationships. Design/methodology/approach This cross-sectional study was conducted among nurses (Québec, Canada). Nurses completed an online questionnaire. To test the proposed moderating effect of satisfaction of the three psychological needs (i.e. autonomy, competence and relatedness) in the relationship between job demands (i.e. role ambiguity and role conflict) and turnover intention, path analysis was conducted using Mplus v.8 (Muthén and Muthen, 2017). Two models, one for each demand, were tested. Findings As expected, role ambiguity and role conflict are positively related to turnover intention. Results reveal a significant interaction between role ambiguity and satisfaction of the need for autonomy in the prediction of turnover intention. The satisfaction of the need for competence and the satisfaction of the need for relatedness did not moderate the relationship between role ambiguity and turnover intention. Satisfaction of the need for autonomy moderated the relationship between role conflict and turnover intention. Moreover, results revealed a significant interaction between role conflict and satisfaction of the need for competence in the prediction of turnover intention. Satisfaction of the need for relatedness did not moderate the relationship between role conflict and turnover intention. Research limitations/implications The results align with the theoretical propositions of several leading theories in occupational health which state that workers’ psychological functioning derives not only from the job characteristics of their work environment, but also from the psychological resources at their disposal. The study contributes to SDT. First, to date, this is the first study to investigate basic psychological need satisfaction as a moderator in the relationship between contextual factors and workers’ functioning. Second, the findings revealed the importance of assessing psychological needs separately, as each contributes in a specific way to workers’ work-related attitudes and adaptation to their professional environment. Practical implications Perceptions of autonomy and competence act as key psychological resources for nurses. Managerial support for autonomy (e.g. providing nurses with meaningful information regarding their work) and competence (e.g. providing nurses with frequent positive feedback regarding their work efforts) constitutes a series of key management practices that can foster perceptions of autonomy and competence. The findings show that two role stressors predict nurses’ turnover intention. As such, health care establishments are encouraged to focus on interventions that reduce uncertainties and conflicting situations from nurses (provide clear job descriptions and effective communication). Social implications By promoting a sense of effectiveness and feelings of self-endorsement at work, health care establishments can reduce nurses’ turnover intention and help prevent staffing shortages among this important work group. Originality/value Although past research shows that workers’ motivational profile can modulate the relationship between characteristics within the work environment and workers’ functioning, studying the quality of work motivation is not sufficient to completely understand the factors that can influence workers’ reactions to job demands. Need satisfaction is crucial to the development and maintenance of high quality motivation. Evaluating need satisfaction as a moderator in the stressor–strain relationship could offer a better understanding of the psychological experiences that can promote workers’ adaptation to their work environment. To date, no study has investigated the buffering role of psychological needs in the stressor–strain relationship.},

Whereas previous studies have focused on IER as a methodological nuisance, the current studies examined IER as a substantive variable. Specifically, we hypothesized that IER is a reflection of enduring individual differences. In Study 1, we found that IER displayed rank-order consistency over the course of 13 months; in Studies 2 and 3, we found that IER displayed rank-order consistency across multiple research situations; in Study 4, we found that acquaintance-reported conscientiousness, agreeableness, extraversion, and emotional stability were each negatively related to IER; and in Study 5, we found that IER was related to college grade point average and class absences. Together, these 5 studies suggest that IER is in part a manifestation of enduring individual differences.},

Yet psychiatrists and investigators now have an unprecedented opportunity to benefit from complex patterns in brain, behavior, and genes using methods from machine learning (e.g., support vector machines, modern neural-network algorithms, cross-validation procedures). Combining these analysis techniques with a wealth of data from consortia and repositories has the potential to advance a biologically grounded redefinition of major psychiatric disorders. Increasing evidence suggests that data-derived subgroups of psychiatric patients can better predict treatment outcomes than DSM/ICD diagnoses can. In a new era of evidence-based psychiatry tailored to single patients, objectively measurable endophenotypes could allow for early disease detection, individualized treatment selection, and dosage adjustment to reduce the burden of disease. This primer aims to introduce clinicians and researchers to the opportunities and challenges in bringing machine intelligence into psychiatric practice.},

  abstract = {Early childhood anxiety disorders are common, impairing, and predictive of anxiety and mood disorders later in childhood. Epidemiological studies over the last decade find that the prevalence of impairing anxiety disorders in preschool children ranges from 0.3\% to 6.5\%. Yet, less than 15\% of young children with an impairing anxiety disorder receive a mental health evaluation or treatment. One possible reason for the low rate of care for anxious preschoolers is the lack of affordable, timely, reliable and valid tools for identifying young children with clinically significant anxiety. Diagnostic interviews assessing psychopathology in young children require intensive training, take hours to administer and code, and are not available for use outside of research settings. The Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment (PAPA) is a reliable and valid structured diagnostic parent-report interview for assessing psychopathology, including anxiety disorders, in 2 to 5 year old children. In this paper, we apply machine-learning tools to already collected PAPA data from two large community studies to identify sub-sets of PAPA items that could be developed into an efficient, reliable, and valid screening tool to assess a young child’s risk for an anxiety disorder. Using machine learning, we were able to decrease by an order of magnitude the number of items needed to identify a child who is at risk for an anxiety disorder with an accuracy of over 96\% for both generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and separation anxiety disorder (SAD). Additionally, rather than considering GAD or SAD as discrete/binary entities, we present a continuous risk score representing the child’s risk of meeting criteria for GAD or SAD. Identification of a short question-set that assesses risk for an anxiety disorder could be a first step toward development and validation of a relatively short screening tool feasible for use in pediatric clinics and daycare/preschool settings.},

  abstract = {Background: Since the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) in 1955, the applications of AI have increased over the years within a rapidly changing digital landscape where public expectations are on the rise, fed by social media, industry leaders, and medical practitioners. However, there has been little interest in AI in medical education until the last two decades, with only a recent increase in the number of publications and citations in the field. To our knowledge, thus far, a limited number of articles have discussed or reviewed the current use of AI in medical education. Objective: This study aims to review the current applications of AI in medical education as well as the challenges of implementing AI in medical education. Methods: Medline (Ovid), EBSCOhost Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) and Education Source, and Web of Science were searched with explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria. Full text of the selected articles was analyzed using the Extension of Technology Acceptance Model and the Diffusions of Innovations theory. Data were subsequently pooled together and analyzed quantitatively. Results: A total of 37 articles were identified. Three primary uses of AI in medical education were identified: learning support (n=32), assessment of students’ learning (n=4), and curriculum review (n=1). The main reasons for use of AI are its ability to provide feedback and a guided learning pathway and to decrease costs. Subgroup analysis revealed that medical undergraduates are the primary target audience for AI use. In addition, 34 articles described the challenges of AI implementation in medical education; two main reasons were identified: difficulty in assessing the effectiveness of AI in medical education and technical challenges while developing AI applications. Conclusions: The primary use of AI in medical education was for learning support mainly due to its ability to provide individualized feedback. Little emphasis was placed on curriculum review and assessment of students’ learning due to the lack of digitalization and sensitive nature of examinations, respectively. Big data manipulation also warrants the need to ensure data integrity. Methodological improvements are required to increase AI adoption by addressing the technical difficulties of creating an AI application and using novel methods to assess the effectiveness of AI. To better integrate AI into the medical profession, measures should be taken to introduce AI into the medical school curriculum for medical professionals to better understand AI algorithms and maximize its use.},

  abstract = {For many years, psychiatrists have tried to understand factors involved in response to medications or psychotherapies, in order to personalize their treatment choices. There is now a broad and growing interest in the idea that we can develop models to personalize treatment decisions using new statistical approaches from the field of machine learning and applying them to larger volumes of data. In this pursuit, there has been a paradigm shift away from experimental studies to confirm or refute specific hypotheses towards a focus on the overall explanatory power of a predictive model when tested on new, unseen datasets. In this paper, we review key studies using machine learning to predict treatment outcomes in psychiatry, ranging from medications and psychotherapies to digital interventions and neurobiological treatments. Next, we focus on some new sources of data that are being used for the development of predictive models based on machine learning, such as electronic health records, smartphone and social media data, and on the potential utility of data from genetics, electrophysiology, neuroimaging and cognitive testing. Finally, we discuss how far the field has come towards implementing prediction tools in real-world clinical practice. Relatively few retrospective studies to-date include appropriate external validation procedures, and there are even fewer prospective studies testing the clinical feasibility and effectiveness of predictive models. Applications of machine learning in psychiatry face some of the same ethical challenges posed by these techniques in other areas of medicine or computer science, which we discuss here. In short, machine learning is a nascent but important approach to improve the effectiveness of mental health care, and several prospective clinical studies suggest that it may be working already.},

  abstract = {For many years, psychiatrists have tried to understand factors involved in response to medications or psychotherapies, in order to personalize their treatment choices. There is now a broad and growing interest in the idea that we can develop models to personalize treatment decisions using new statistical approaches from the field of machine learning and applying them to larger volumes of data. In this pursuit, there has been a paradigm shift away from experimental studies to confirm or refute specific hypotheses towards a focus on the overall explanatory power of a predictive model when tested on new, unseen datasets. In this paper, we review key studies using machine learning to predict treatment outcomes in psychiatry, ranging from medications and psychotherapies to digital interventions and neurobiological treatments. Next, we focus on some new sources of data that are being used for the development of predictive models based on machine learning, such as electronic health records, smartphone and social media data, and on the potential utility of data from genetics, electrophysiology, neuroimaging and cognitive testing. Finally, we discuss how far the field has come towards implementing prediction tools in real-world clinical practice. Relatively few retrospective studies to-date include appropriate external validation procedures, and there are even fewer prospective studies testing the clinical feasibility and effectiveness of predictive models. Applications of machine learning in psychiatry face some of the same ethical challenges posed by these techniques in other areas of medicine or computer science, which we discuss here. In short, machine learning is a nascent but important approach to improve the effectiveness of mental health care, and several prospective clinical studies suggest that it may be working already.},

Crucial to their adoption is the involvement of different professional groups, namely radiologists and radiographers, who work interdependently but whose perceptions and responses towards AI may differ. We aim to explore the knowledge, awareness and attitudes towards AI amongst professional groups in radiology, and to analyse the implications for the future adoption of these technologies into practice.                                            Methods                We conducted 18 semi-structured interviews with 12 radiologists and 6 radiographers from four breast units in National Health Services (NHS) organisations and one focus group with 8 radiographers from a fifth NHS breast unit, between 2018 and 2020.                                            Results                We found that radiographers and radiologists vary with respect to their awareness and knowledge around AI. Through their professional networks, conference attendance, and contacts with industry developers, radiologists receive more information and acquire more knowledge of the potential applications of AI. Radiographers instead rely more on localized personal networks for information. Our results also show that although both groups believe AI innovations offer a potential solution to workforce shortages, they differ significantly regarding the impact they believe it will have on their professional roles. Radiologists believe AI has the potential to take on more repetitive tasks and allow them to focus on more interesting and challenging work. They are less concerned that AI technology might constrain their professional role and autonomy. Radiographers showed greater concern about the potential impact that AI technology could have on their roles and skills development. They were less confident of their ability to respond positively to the potential risks and opportunities posed by AI technology.                                            Conclusions                In summary, our findings suggest that professional responses to AI are linked to existing work roles, but are also mediated by differences in knowledge and attitudes attributable to inter-professional differences in status and identity. These findings question broad-brush assertions about the future deskilling impact of AI which neglect the need for AI innovations in healthcare to be integrated into existing work processes subject to high levels of professional autonomy.},

Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are playing an increasingly critical role in the new era of precision psychiatry. Combining ML/AI with neuromodulation technologies can potentially provide explainable solutions in clinical practice and effective therapeutic treatment. Advanced wearable and mobile technologies also call for the new role of ML/AI for digital phenotyping in mobile mental health. In this review, we provide a comprehensive review of the ML methodologies and applications by combining neuroimaging, neuromodulation, and advanced mobile technologies in psychiatry practice. Additionally, we review the role of ML in molecular phenotyping and cross-species biomarker identification in precision psychiatry. We further discuss explainable AI (XAI) and causality testing in a closed-human-in-the-loop manner, and highlight the ML potential in multimedia information extraction and multimodal data fusion. Finally, we discuss conceptual and practical challenges in precision psychiatry and highlight ML opportunities in future research.},

  abstract = {Objective Enhanced technology in computer and internet has driven scale and quality of data to be improved in various areas including healthcare sectors. Machine Learning (ML) has played a pivotal role in efficiently analyzing those big data, but a general misunderstanding of ML algorithms still exists in applying them (e.g., ML techniques can settle a problem of small sample size, or deep learning is the ML algorithm). This paper reviewed the research of diagnosing mental illness using ML algorithm and suggests how ML techniques can be employed and worked in practice. Methods Researches about mental illness diagnostic using ML techniques were carefully reviewed. Five traditional ML algorithms-Support Vector Machines (SVM), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighborhood (KNN)-frequently used for mental health area researches were systematically organized and summarized. Results Based on literature review, it turned out that Support Vector Machines (SVM), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighborhood (KNN) were frequently employed in mental health area, but many researchers did not clarify the reason for using their ML algorithm though every ML algorithm has its own advantages. In addition, there were several studies to apply ML algorithms without fully understanding the data characteristics. Conclusion Researchers using ML algorithms should be aware of the properties of their ML algorithms and the limitation of the results they obtained under restricted data conditions. This paper provides useful information of the properties and limitation of each ML algorithm in the practice of mental health.},

  abstract = {Background Although telehealth offers an improved approach to providing healthcare services, its adoption by end users remains slow. With an older population as the main target, these traditionally conservative users pose a big challenge to the successful implementation of innovative telehealth services. Objectives The objective of this study was to develop and empirically test a model for predicting the factors affecting older users’ acceptance of Home Telehealth Services (HTS). Methods A survey instrument was administered to 400 participants aged 50 years and above from both rural and urban environments in Slovenia. Structural equation modeling was applied to analyze the causal effect of seven hypothesized predicting factors. HTS were introduced as a bundle of functionalities, representing future services that currently do not exist. This enabled users’ perceptions to be measured on the conceptual level, rather than attitudes to a specific technical solution. Results Six relevant predictors were confirmed in older users’ HTS acceptance behavior, with Performance Expectancy (r=0.30), Effort Expectancy (r=0.49), Facilitating Conditions (r=0.12), and Perceived Security (r=0.16) having a direct impact on behavioral intention to use HTS. In addition, Computer Anxiety is positioned as an antecedent of Effort Expectancy with a strong negative influence (r=−0.61), and Doctor’s Opinion influence showed a strong impact on Performance Expectancy (r=0.31). The results also indicate Social Influence as an irrelevant predictor of acceptance behavior. The model of six predictors yielded 77\% of the total variance explained in the final measured Behavioral Intention to Use HTS by older adults. Conclusion The level at which HTS are perceived as easy to use and manage is the leading acceptance predictor in older users’ HTS acceptance. Together with Perceived Usefulness and Perceived Security, these three factors represent the key influence on older people’s HTS acceptance behavior. When promoting HTS, interventions should focus to portray it as secure. Marketing interventions should focus also on promoting HTS among health professionals, using them as social agents to frame the services as useful and beneficial. The important role of computer anxiety may result in a need to use different equipment such as a tablet computer to access HTS. Finally, this paper introduces important methodological guidelines for measuring perceptions on a conceptual level of future services that currently do not exist.},

Of 24,000 ESR members contacted, 675 (2.8\%) completed the survey, 454 males (67\%), 555 (82\%) working at academic/public hospitals. AI impact was mostly expected (≥ 30\% of responders) on breast, oncologic, thoracic, and neuro imaging, mainly involving mammography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance. Responders foresee AI impact on: job opportunities (375/675, 56\%), 218/375 (58\%) expecting increase, 157/375 (42\%) reduction; reporting workload (504/675, 75\%), 256/504 (51\%) expecting reduction, 248/504 (49\%) increase; radiologist’s profile, becoming more clinical (364/675, 54\%) and more subspecialised (283/675, 42\%). For 374/675 responders (55\%) AI-only reports would be not accepted by patients, for 79/675 (12\%) accepted, for 222/675 (33\%) it is too early to answer. For 275/675 responders (41\%) AI will make the radiologist-patient relation more interactive, for 140/675 (21\%) more impersonal, for 259/675 (38\%) unchanged. If AI allows time saving, radiologists should interact more with clinicians (437/675, 65\%) and/or patients (322/675, 48\%). For all responders, involvement in AI-projects is welcome, with different roles: supervision (434/675, 64\%), task definition (359/675, 53\%), image labelling (197/675, 29\%). Of 675 responders, 321 (48\%) do not currently use AI, 138 (20\%) use AI, 205 (30\%) are planning to do it. According to 277/675 responders (41\%), radiologists will take responsibility for AI outcome, while 277/675 (41\%) suggest shared responsibility with other professionals. To summarise, responders showed a general favourable attitude towards AI.},

Stakeholder feedback may facilitate adoption of such tools. This evaluation gathered stakeholder feedback and preferences to explore whether it would be fundamentally feasible or possible to implement an automated fidelity-scoring supervision tool in community mental health settings. A partially mixed, sequential research method design was used including focus group discussions with community mental health therapists (n\,=\,18) and clinical leadership (n\,=\,12) to explore typical supervision practices, followed by discussion of an automated fidelity feedback tool embedded in a cloud-based supervision platform. Interpretation of qualitative findings was enhanced through quantitative measures of participants’ use of technology and perceptions of acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of the tool. Initial perceptions of acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of automated fidelity tools were positive and increased after introduction of an automated tool. Standard supervision was described as collaboratively guided and focused on clinical content, self-care, and documentation. Participants highlighted the tool’s utility for supervision, training, and professional growth, but questioned its ability to evaluate rapport, cultural responsiveness, and non-verbal communication. Concerns were raised about privacy and the impact of low scores on therapist confidence. Desired features included intervention labeling and transparency about how scores related to session content. Opportunities for asynchronous, remote, and targeted supervision were particularly valued. Stakeholder feedback suggests that automated fidelity measurement could augment supervision practices. Future research should examine the relations among use of such supervision tools, clinician skill, and client outcomes.},

  abstract = {With the advent of digital approaches to mental health, modern artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning in particular, is being used in the development of prediction, detection and treatment solutions for mental health care. In terms of treatment, AI is being incorporated into digital interventions, particularly web and smartphone apps, to enhance user experience and optimise personalised mental health care. In terms of prediction and detection, modern streams of abundant data mean that data-driven AI methods can be employed to develop prediction/detection models for mental health conditions. In particular, an individual’s ‘digital exhaust’, the data gathered from their numerous personal digital device and social media interactions, can be mined for behavioural or mental health insights. Language, long considered a window into the human mind, can now be quantitatively harnessed as data with powerful computer-based natural language processing to also provide a method of inferring mental health. Furthermore, natural language processing can also be used to develop conversational agents used for therapeutic intervention.},

Most subjective measures used in practice are unvalidated, and their relationship to system usage is unknown. The present research develops and validates new scales for two specific variables, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, which are hypothesized to be fundamental determinants of user acceptance. Definitions for these two variables were used to develop scale items that were pretested for content validity and then tested for reliability and construct validity in two studies involving a total of 152 users and four application programs. The measures were refined and stream-lined, resulting in two six-item scales with reliabilities of.98 for usefulness and.94 for ease of use. The scales exhibited high convergent, discriminant, and factorial validity. Perceived usefulness was significantly correlated with both self-reported current usage (r=.63, Study 1) and self-predicted future usage (r=.85, Study 2). Perceived ease of use was also significantly correlated with current usage (r=.45, Study 1) and future usage (r=.59, Study 2). In both studies, usefulness had a significantly greater correlation with usage behavior than did ease of use. Regression analyses suggest that perceived ease of use may actually be a causal antecedent to perceived usefulness, as opposed to a parallel, direct determinant of system usage. Implications are drawn for future research on user acceptance.}

  abstract = {Background Hospital staff is at high risk of developing mental health issues during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. However, the literature lacks an overall and inclusive picture of mental health problems with comprehensive analysis among hospital staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objectives To ascertain the prevalence of anxiety, depression and other mental health outcomes as reported in original articles among hospital staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design A PRISMA 2020 and MOOSE 2000 compliant umbrella review of published meta-analyses of observational studies evaluating the prevalence of mental health problems in hospital staff during the pandemic. Review methods Systematic searches were conducted in PubMed/Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, and PsycINFO from December 1st, 2019, until August 13th 2021. The random effects model was used for the meta-analysis, and the I2 index was employed to assess between-study heterogeneity. Publication bias using Egger test and LFK index was examined. Data was analyzed using STATA 17.0 software. AMSTAR-2 was applied for the quality assessment of systematic reviews, while we used GRADE to rate the quality of evidence. Results Forty-four meta-analyses from 1298 individual studies were included in the final analysis, encompassing the prevalence of 16 mental health symptoms. One-third of hospital workers reported anxiety (Prevalence: 29.9\%, 95\% CI:27.1\% to 32.7\%) and depression (Prevalence: 28.4\%, 95\% CI:25.5\% to 31.3\%) symptomatology, while about 40\% (95\% CI: 36.9\% to 42.0\%) suffered from sleeping disorders. Fear-related symptoms, reduced well-being, poor quality of life, and acute stress symptoms had the highest prevalence among hospital staff. However, the quality of evidence in these areas varied from low to very low. Nurses suffered more often from sleep problems and symptoms of anxiety and depression than doctors, whereas doctors reported a higher prevalence of acute stress and post-traumatic disorders. The burden of anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders was higher among female employees than their male counterparts. Remarkably, acute stress and insomnia affected more than half of first-line medical staff. Conclusions The prevalence of mental health problems among hospital staff during the COVID-19 pandemic is generally high, with anxiety, depression and insomnia symptoms representing the most robust evidence based on a large dataset of prevalence meta-analyses. However, there is no strong confidence in the body of evidence for each outcome assessed. Registration Not registered. Tweetable abstract The COVID-19 pandemic is having a major impact on the mental health of hospital staff. The need for support must be different for nurses and doctors @eldi12345.},

Results indicated that FIML estimation was superior across all conditions of the design. Under ignorable missing data conditions (missing completely at random and missing at random), FIML estimates were unbiased and more efficient than the other methods. In addition, FIML yielded the lowest proportion of convergence failures and provided near-optimal Type 1 error rates across both simulations.},

  abstract = {Background: Deep learning offers considerable promise for medical diagnostics. In this review, we evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of deep learning (DL) algorithms versus health care professionals (HCPs) in classifying diseases from medical imaging.      Methods: We searched (Pre-)Medline, Embase, Science Citation Index, Conference Proceedings Citation Index, and arXiv from 01 January 2012 until 31 May 2018. Studies comparing the diagnostic performance of DL models and HCPs, for any pre-specified condition based on medical imaging material, were included. We extracted binary diagnostic accuracy data and constructed contingency tables at the reported thresholds to derive the outcomes of interest: sensitivity and specificity. Studies undertaking an out-of-sample validation were included in a meta-analysis.      Results: 24 studies, from a starting number of 19889, compared DL models with HCPs. 22 studies provided enough data to construct contingency tables, enabling calculation of test accuracy. The mean sensitivity for DL models was 78\% (range 13 - 100\%), and mean specificity was 86\% (range 51 - 100\%). An out-of-sample external validation was performed by 5 studies and were therefore included in the meta-analysis. We found a pooled sensitivity of 86\% (95\% CI: 84 - 88\%) for DL models and 93\% (95\% CI: 87 - 97\%) for HCPs, and a pooled specificity of 88\% (95\% CI: 84 - 92\%) for DL models and 87\% (95\% CI: 84 - 89\%) for HCPs.     Conclusion: Our review found the diagnostic performance of deep learning models to be similar to health care professionals. A major finding was the poor reporting and potential biases arising from study design that limited reliable interpretation of the reported diagnostic accuracy. New reporting standards which address specific challenges of deep learning could improve future studies, enabling greater confidence in the results of future evaluations of this promising technology.Funding Statement: The authors state: "None"Declaration of Interests: All authors have completed the ICMJE uniform disclosure form online (available on request from the corresponding author) and declare: no support from any organization for the submitted work; no financial relationships with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work in the previous three years; no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.Ethics Approval Statement: The authors state: "Not required."

Besides, two groups of additional factors, related to AIMDSS (task complexity, technology characteristics, and perceived substitution crisis) and health professionals’ characteristics (propensity to trust and personal innovativeness in IT) are considered in the integrated model. The data set of proposed research model is collected through paper survey and Internet survey in China. The empirical examination demonstrates a high predictive power of this proposed model in explaining AIMDSS adoption.

  abstract = {Introduction:  According to the World Health Organization (WHO), over 130 million people are in constant need of humanitarian assistance due to natural disasters, disease outbreaks, and conflicts, among other factors. These health crises can compromise the resilience of healthcare systems, which are essential for achieving the health objectives of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the United Nations (UN). During a humanitarian health crisis, rapid and informed decision making is required. This is often challenging due to information scarcity, limited resources, and strict time constraints. Moreover, the traditional approach to digital health development, which involves a substantial requirement analysis, a feasibility study, and deployment of technology, is ill-suited for many crisis contexts. The emergence of Web 2.0 technologies and social media platforms in the past decade, such as Twitter, has created a new paradigm of massive information and misinformation, in which new technologies need to be developed to aid rapid decision making during humanitarian health crises. Objective: Humanitarian health crises increasingly require the analysis of massive amounts of information produced by different sources, such as social media content, and, hence, they are a prime case for the use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to help identify relevant information and make it actionable. To identify challenges and opportunities for using AI in humanitarian health crises, we reviewed the literature on the use of AI techniques to process social media. Methodology: We performed a narrative literature review aimed at identifying examples of the use of AI in humanitarian health crises. Our search strategy was designed to get a broad overview of the different applications of AI in a humanitarian health crisis and their challenges. A total of 1459 articles were screened, and 24 articles were included in the final analysis. Results: Successful case studies of AI applications in a humanitarian health crisis have been reported, such as for outbreak detection. A commonly shared concern in the reviewed literature is the technical challenge of analyzing large amounts of data in real time. Data interoperability, which is essential to data sharing, is also a barrier with regard to the integration of online and traditional data sources. Human and organizational aspects that might be key factors for the adoption of AI and social media remain understudied. There is also a publication bias toward high-income countries, as we identified few examples in low-income countries. Further, we did not identify any examples of certain types of major crisis, such armed conflicts, in which misinformation might be more common. Conclusions: The feasibility of using AI to extract valuable information during a humanitarian health crisis is proven in many cases. There is a lack of research on how to integrate the use of AI into the work-flow and large-scale deployments of humanitarian aid during a health crisis.}

  abstract = {Background: Research in embodied artificial intelligence (AI) has increasing clinical relevance for therapeutic applications in mental health services. With innovations ranging from ‘virtual psychotherapists’ to social robots in dementia care and autism disorder, to robots for sexual disorders, artificially intelligent virtual and robotic agents are increasingly taking on high-level therapeutic interventions that used to be offered exclusively by highly trained, skilled health professionals. In order to enable responsible clinical implementation, ethical and social implications of the increasing use of embodied AI in mental health need to be identified and addressed. Objective: This paper assesses the ethical and social implications of translating embodied AI applications into mental health care across the fields of Psychiatry, Psychology and Psychotherapy. Building on this analysis, it develops a set of preliminary recommendations on how to address ethical and social challenges in current and future applications of embodied AI. Methods: Based on a thematic literature search and established principles of medical ethics, an analysis of the ethical and social aspects of currently embodied AI applications was conducted across the fields of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Psychotherapy. To enable a comprehensive evaluation, the analysis was structured around the following three steps: assessment of potential benefits; analysis of overarching ethical issues and concerns; discussion of specific ethical and social issues of the interventions. Results: From an ethical perspective, important benefits of embodied AI applications in mental health include new modes of treatment, opportunities to engage hard-to-reach populations, better patient response, and freeing up time for physicians. Overarching ethical issues and concerns include: harm prevention and various questions of data ethics; a lack of guidance on development of AI applications, their clinical integration and training of health professionals; ‘gaps’ in ethical and regulatory frameworks; the potential for misuse including using the technologies to replace established services, thereby potentially exacerbating existing health inequalities. Specific challenges identified and discussed in the application of embodied AI include: matters of risk-assessment, referrals, and supervision; the need to respect and protect patient autonomy; the role of non-human therapy; transparency in the use of algorithms; and specific concerns regarding long-term effects of these applications on understandings of illness and the human condition. Conclusions: We argue that embodied AI is a promising approach across the field of mental health; however, further research is needed to address the broader ethical and societal concerns of these technologies to negotiate best research and medical practices in innovative mental health care. We conclude by indicating areas of future research and developing recommendations for high-priority areas in need of concrete ethical guidance.},

  abstract = {Background Students with complex health care services process face constant challenges with regard to health education. The mobile devices are an important tool that can install various applications for using information such as clinical guidelines, drug resources, clinical calculations, and the latest scientific evidence without any time and place limitations. And this happens only when students accept and use it. Objective The purpose of this article is to identify the factors influencing students in their intention to use mobile health (mHealth) by using Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. Methods A standard questionnaire was used to collect the data from nearly 302 Lorestan University of medical science students including nutrition and public health, paramedicine, nursing and midwifery, pharmacy, dentistry, and medical schools. The data were processed using LISREL (Scientific Software International, Inc., Lincolnwood, Illinois) and SPSS (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York) softwares and the statistical analysis technique was based on structural equation modeling (SEM). Result A total of 300 questionnaires including valid responses were used in this study. The results showed that mediator of age did not affect the predictors of intention to use mHealth, and the level of education and gender directly affected the intention to use. In addition, effort expectancy, facilitating condition, and behavioral intention directly and indirectly have effect on use, whereas the result revealed no significant relationship between two important processes of performance expectancy and social influence with students’ behavioral intention to use the mHealth. Conclusions The present study provides valuable information on mobile health acceptance factors for widespread use of this device among students of universities of medical sciences as a base infrastructure for a variety of information about health services and learning. Review and comparison of results with other studies showed that mHealth acceptance factors were different from other end users (elderly, patients, and health professionals).},

Methods                Radiation oncologists (ROs), medical physicists (MPs), treatment planners (TP-RTTs) and treatment delivery radiation therapists (TD-RTTs) at a cancer centre in preliminary stages of implementing an AI-enabled treatment planning system were invited to participate in uniprofessional focus groups. Semi-structured scripts addressed the perceptions of AI, including thoughts regarding changing roles and competencies. Sessions were audiorecorded, transcribed and coded thematically through consensus-building.                                            Results                A total of 24 participants (four ROs, five MPs, seven TP-RTTs and eight TD-RTTs) were engaged in four focus groups of 58 minutes average duration (range 54–61 minutes). Emergent themes addressed AI’s impact on quality of care, changing professional tasks and changing competency requirements. Time-consuming repetitive tasks such as delineating targets, generating treatment plans and quality assurance were thought conducive to offloading to AI. Outcomes data and adaptive planning would be incorporated into clinical decision-making. Changing workload would necessitate changing skills, prioritising plan evaluation over generation and increasing interprofessional communication. All groups discussed AI reducing the need for TP-RTTs, though displacement was thought more likely than replacement.                                            Conclusions                It is important to consider how professionals perceive AI to be proactive in informing change, as gains in quality and efficiency will require new workflows, skills and education.},

Data from semi-structured interviews with 28 students from five medical faculties were used to construct an online survey send to about 80,000 medical students in Germany. Most students expressed positive attitudes towards digital applications in medicine. Students with a problem-based curriculum (PBC) in contrast to those with a science-based curriculum (SBC) and male undergraduate students think that AI solutions result in better diagnosis than those from physicians (p {$<$} 0.001). Male undergraduate students had the most positive view of AI (p {$<$} 0.002). Around 38\% of the students felt ill-prepared and could not answer AI-related questions because digitization in medicine and AI are not a formal part of the medical curriculum. AI rating regarding the usefulness in diagnostics differed significantly between groups. Higher emphasis in medical curriculum of digital solutions in patient care is postulated.},

  abstract = {Background: Machine learning systems are part of the field of artificial intelligence that automatically learn models from data to make better decisions. Natural language processing (NLP), by using corpora and learning approaches, provides good performance in statistical tasks, such as text classification or sentiment mining. Objective: The primary aim of this systematic review was to summarize and characterize, in methodological and technical terms, studies that used machine learning and NLP techniques for mental health. The secondary aim was to consider the potential use of these methods in mental health clinical practice Methods: This systematic review follows the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis) guidelines and is registered with PROSPERO (Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews; number CRD42019107376). The search was conducted using 4 medical databases (PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and PsycINFO) with the following keywords: machine learning, data mining, psychiatry, mental health, and mental disorder. The exclusion criteria were as follows: languages other than English, anonymization process, case studies, conference papers, and reviews. No limitations on publication dates were imposed. Results: A total of 327 articles were identified, of which 269 (82.3\%) were excluded and 58 (17.7\%) were included in the review. The results were organized through a qualitative perspective. Although studies had heterogeneous topics and methods, some themes emerged. Population studies could be grouped into 3 categories: patients included in medical databases, patients who came to the emergency room, and social media users. The main objectives were to extract symptoms, classify severity of illness, compare therapy effectiveness, provide psychopathological clues, and challenge the current nosography. Medical records and social media were the 2 major data sources. With regard to the methods used, preprocessing used the standard methods of NLP and unique identifier extraction dedicated to medical texts. Efficient classifiers were preferred rather than transparent functioning classifiers. Python was the most frequently used platform. Conclusions: Machine learning and NLP models have been highly topical issues in medicine in recent years and may be considered a new paradigm in medical research. However, these processes tend to confirm clinical hypotheses rather than developing entirely new information, and only one major category of the population (ie, social media users) is an imprecise cohort. Moreover, some language-specific features can improve the performance of NLP methods, and their extension to other languages should be more closely investigated. However, machine learning and NLP techniques provide useful information from unexplored data (ie, patients’ daily habits that are usually inaccessible to care providers). Before considering It as an additional tool of mental health care, ethical issues remain and should be discussed in a timely manner. Machine learning and NLP methods may offer multiple perspectives in mental health research but should also be considered as tools to support clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Rationale and Objectives Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform the clinical practice of radiology. This study investigated Canadian medical students’ perceptions of the impact of AI on radiology, and their influence on the students’ preference for radiology specialty. Materials and Methods In March 2018, an anonymous online survey was distributed to students at all 17 Canadian medical schools. Results Among 322 respondents, 70 students considered radiology as the top specialty choice, and 133 as among the top three choices. Only a minority (29.3\%) of respondents agreed AI would replace radiologists in foreseeable future, but a majority (67.7\%) agreed AI would reduce the demand for radiologists. Even among first-choice respondents, 48.6\% agreed AI caused anxiety when considering the radiology specialty. Furthermore, one-sixth of respondents who would otherwise rank radiology as the first choice would not consider radiology because of the anxiety about AI. Prior significant exposure to radiology and high confidence in understanding of AI were shown to decrease the anxiety level. Interested students valued the opinions of local radiologists, radiology conferences, and journals. Students were most interested in “expert opinions on AI” and “discussing AI in preclinical radiology lectures” to understand the impact of AI. Conclusion Anxiety related to “displacement” (not “replacement”) of radiologists by AI discouraged many medical students from considering the radiology specialty. The radiology community should educate medical students about the potential impact of AI, to ensure radiology is perceived as a viable long-term career choice.},

  abstract = {Preserving cognition and mental capacity is critical to aging with autonomy. Early detection of pathological cognitive decline facilitates the greatest impact of restorative or preventative treatments. Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare is the use of computational algorithms that mimic human cognitive functions to analyze complex medical data. AI technologies like machine learning (ML) support the integration of biological, psychological, and social factors when approaching diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of disease. This paper serves to acquaint clinicians and other stakeholders with the use, benefits, and limitations of AI for predicting, diagnosing, and classifying mild and major neurocognitive impairments, by providing a conceptual overview of this topic with emphasis on the features explored and AI techniques employed. We present studies that fell into six categories of features used for these purposes: (1) sociodemographics; (2) clinical and psychometric assessments; (3) neuroimaging and neurophysiology; (4) electronic health records and claims; (5) novel assessments (e.g., sensors for digital data); and (6) genomics/other omics. For each category we provide examples of AI approaches, including supervised and unsupervised ML, deep learning, and natural language processing. AI technology, still nascent in healthcare, has great potential to transform the way we diagnose and treat patients with neurocognitive disorders.},

  abstract = {Background: Many promising technological innovations in health and social care are characterized by nonadoption or abandonment by individuals or by failed attempts to scale up locally, spread distantly, or sustain the innovation long term at the organization or system level. Objective: Our objective was to produce an evidence-based, theory-informed, and pragmatic framework to help predict and evaluate the success of a technology-supported health or social care program. Methods: The study had 2 parallel components: (1) secondary research (hermeneutic systematic review) to identify key domains, and (2) empirical case studies of technology implementation to explore, test, and refine these domains. We studied 6 technology-supported programs—video outpatient consultations, global positioning system tracking for cognitive impairment, pendant alarm services, remote biomarker monitoring for heart failure, care organizing software, and integrated case management via data sharing—using longitudinal ethnography and action research for up to 3 years across more than 20 organizations. Data were collected at micro level (individual technology users), meso level (organizational processes and systems), and macro level (national policy and wider context). Analysis and synthesis was aided by sociotechnically informed theories of individual, organizational, and system change. The draft framework was shared with colleagues who were introducing or evaluating other technology-supported health or care programs and refined in response to feedback. Results: The literature review identified 28 previous technology implementation frameworks, of which 14 had taken a dynamic systems approach (including 2 integrative reviews of previous work). Our empirical dataset consisted of over 400 hours of ethnographic observation, 165 semistructured interviews, and 200 documents. The final nonadoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread, and sustainability (NASSS) framework included questions in 7 domains: the condition or illness, the technology, the value proposition, the adopter system (comprising professional staff, patient, and lay caregivers), the organization(s), the wider (institutional and societal) context, and the interaction and mutual adaptation between all these domains over time. Our empirical case studies raised a variety of challenges across all 7 domains, each classified as simple (straightforward, predictable, few components), complicated (multiple interacting components or issues), or complex (dynamic, unpredictable, not easily disaggregated into constituent components). Programs characterized by complicatedness proved difficult but not impossible to implement. Those characterized by complexity in multiple NASSS domains rarely, if ever, became mainstreamed. The framework showed promise when applied (both prospectively and retrospectively) to other programs. Conclusions: Subject to further empirical testing, NASSS could be applied across a range of technological innovations in health and social care. It has several potential uses: (1) to inform the design of a new technology; (2) to identify technological solutions that (perhaps despite policy or industry enthusiasm) have a limited chance of achieving large-scale, sustained adoption; (3) to plan the implementation, scale-up, or rollout of a technology program; and (4) to explain and learn from program failures.},

The literature includes various intervention programs aiming to increase technology acceptance in this field. In this review, studies investigating the factors influencing the technology acceptance and recent interventions intending to enhance the technology usage in the field are covered. Generally, theory of planned behavior, technology acceptance model, diffusion of innovation theory and unified theory of technology acceptance cover the most distinguished concepts and constructs to understand attitudes towards technological innovations. Influencing factors may differ for health care professionals and patients. While perceived benefits of technological innovations may be the most distinctive factor for health care professionals, ease of use is of big importance for patients. Perceived ease of use is affected by personal norms and perceived control beliefs. Suspicions of confidentiality and privacy are strong influencing factors for refusing technology usage for patients. Considering all these factors are necessary while designing intervention programs to enhance technology acceptance in health care. In the conclusion, the paper discusses whether the intervention programs originate from previously covered theoretical concepts and constructs.},

We focus on two aspects of clinical artificial intelligence used for decision-making: moral accountability for harm to patients; and safety assurance to protect patients against such harm. Artificial intelligence-based tools are challenging the standard clinical practices of assigning blame and assuring safety. Human clinicians and safety engineers have weaker control over the decisions reached by artificial intelligence systems and less knowledge and understanding of precisely how the artificial intelligence systems reach their decisions. We illustrate this analysis by applying it to an example of an artificial intelligence-based system developed for use in the treatment of sepsis. The paper ends with practical suggestions for ways forward to mitigate these concerns. We argue for a need to include artificial intelligence developers and systems safety engineers in our assessments of moral accountability for patient harm. Meanwhile, none of the actors in the model robustly fulfil the traditional conditions of moral accountability for the decisions of an artificial intelligence system. We should therefore update our conceptions of moral accountability in this context. We also need to move from a static to a dynamic model of assurance, accepting that considerations of safety are not fully resolvable during the design of the artificial intelligence system before the system has been deployed.},

In particular, “precision medicine,” a medical treatment that selects the most appropriate treatment for each patient based on a vast amount of medical data such as genome information, has become a worldwide trend; AI technology is expected to be utilized in the process of extracting truly useful information from a large amount of medical data and applying it to diagnosis and treatment. In this review, we would like to introduce the history of AI technology and the current state of medical AI, especially in the oncology field, as well as discuss the possibilities and challenges of AI technology in the medical field.},

  abstract = {Background mHealth (mobile health) services are becoming an increasingly important form of information and communication technology (ICT) enabled delivery for healthcare, especially in low-resource environments such as developing countries like Bangladesh. Despite widespread adoption of mobile phones and the acknowledged potential of using them to improve healthcare services, the adoption and acceptance of this technology among the elderly is significantly low. However, little research has been done to draw any systematic study of the elderly’s intention to adopt mHealth services. Objective The aim of this study was to develop a theoretical model based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and then empirically test it for determining the key factors influencing elderly users’ intention to adopt and use the mHealth services. Methods A face-to-face structured questionnaire survey method was used to collect data from nearly 300 participants of age 60 years and above from the capital city of Bangladesh. The data were analyzed using the Partial Least Squares (PLS) method, a statistical analysis technique based upon Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Results The study determined that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, technology anxiety, and resistance to change (p{$<$}0.05) had a significant impact on the users’ behavioral intention to adopt mHealth services. The study, however, revealed no significant relation between the facilitating condition and the users’ behavioral intention to use the mHealth services (p{$>$}0.05). Conclusions This study confirms the applicability of UTAUT model in the context of mHealth services among the elderly in developing countries like Bangladesh. It provides valuable information for mHealth service providers and policy makers in understanding the adoption challenges and the issues and also provides practical guidance for the successful implementation of mHealth services. Additionally the empirical findings identify implications related to the design and development of mHealth services that influence potential users. Furthermore, due to a generic approach, the findings of this study could be easily modified to assist other developing countries in the planning and up-take of mHealth services.},

We investigated knowledge and attitude towards AI by radiologists and residents in Europe and beyond.                                            Methods                Between April and July 2019, a survey on fear of replacement, knowledge, and attitude towards AI was accessible to radiologists and residents. The survey was distributed through several radiological societies, author networks, and social media. Independent predictors of fear of replacement and a positive attitude towards AI were assessed using multivariable logistic regression.                                            Results                                  The survey was completed by 1,041 respondents from 54 mostly European countries. Most respondents were male (                  n                  = 670, 65\%), median age was 38 (24–74) years,                  n                  = 142 (35\%) residents, and                  n                  = 471 (45\%) worked in an academic center. Basic AI-specific knowledge was associated with fear (adjusted OR 1.56, 95\% CI 1.10–2.21,                  p                  = 0.01), while intermediate AI-specific knowledge (adjusted OR 0.40, 95\% CI 0.20–0.80,                  p                  = 0.01) or advanced AI-specific knowledge (adjusted OR 0.43, 95\% CI 0.21–0.90,                  p                  = 0.03) was inversely associated with fear. A positive attitude towards AI was observed in 48\% (                  n                  = 501) and was associated with only having heard of AI, intermediate (adjusted OR 11.65, 95\% CI 4.25–31.92,                  p                  {$<$} 0.001), or advanced AI-specific knowledge (adjusted OR 17.65, 95\% CI 6.16–50.54,                  p                  {$<$} 0.001).                                                            Conclusions                Limited AI-specific knowledge levels among radiology residents and radiologists are associated with fear, while intermediate to advanced AI-specific knowledge levels are associated with a positive attitude towards AI. Additional training may therefore improve clinical adoption.                                            Key Points                                  • Forty-eight percent of radiologists and residents have an open and proactive attitude towards artificial intelligence (AI), while 38\% fear of replacement by AI.                                                  • Intermediate and advanced AI-specific knowledge levels may enhance adoption of AI in clinical practice, while rudimentary knowledge levels appear to be inhibitive.                                                  • AI should be incorporated in radiology training curricula to help facilitate its clinical adoption.},

Also, controversy exists if and to what extent AI should be incorporated into radiology residency programs.                                            Methods                Between April and July 2019, an international survey took place on AI regarding its impact on the profession and training. The survey was accessible for radiologists and residents and distributed through several radiological societies. Relationships of independent variables with opinions, hurdles, and education were assessed using multivariable logistic regression.                                            Results                                  The survey was completed by 1041 respondents from 54 countries. A majority (                  n                  = 855, 82\%) expects that AI will cause a change to the radiology field within 10 years. Most frequently, expected roles of AI in clinical practice were second reader (                  n                  = 829, 78\%) and work-flow optimization (                  n                  = 802, 77\%). Ethical and legal issues (                  n                  = 630, 62\%) and lack of knowledge (                  n                  = 584, 57\%) were mentioned most often as hurdles to implementation. Expert respondents added lack of labelled images and generalizability issues. A majority (                  n                  = 819, 79\%) indicated that AI should be incorporated in residency programs, while less support for imaging informatics and AI as a subspecialty was found (                  n                  = 241, 23\%).                                                            Conclusions                Broad community demand exists for incorporation of AI into residency programs. Based on the results of the current study, integration of AI education seems advisable for radiology residents, including issues related to data management, ethics, and legislation.                                            Key Points                                  • There is broad demand from the radiological community to incorporate AI into residency programs, but there is less support to recognize imaging informatics as a radiological subspecialty                  .                                                  • Ethical and legal issues and lack of knowledge are recognized as major bottlenecks for AI implementation by the radiological community, while the shortage in labeled data and IT-infrastructure issues are less often recognized as hurdles                  .                                                  • Integrating AI education in radiology curricula including technical aspects of data management, risk of bias, and ethical and legal issues may aid successful integration of AI into diagnostic radiology                  .},

  abstract = {Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common disabling psychiatric disorder associated with consistent deficits in error processing, inhibition and regionally decreased grey matter volumes. The diagnosis is based on clinical presentation, interviews and questionnaires, which are to some degree subjective and would benefit from verification through biomarkers. Here, pattern recognition of multiple discriminative functional and structural brain patterns was applied to classify adolescents with ADHD and controls. Functional activation features in a Flanker/NoGo task probing error processing and inhibition along with structural magnetic resonance imaging data served to predict group membership using support vector machines (SVMs). The SVM pattern recognition algorithm correctly classified 77.78~\% of the subjects with a sensitivity and specificity of 77.78~\% based on error processing. Predictive regions for controls were mainly detected in core areas for error processing and attention such as the medial and dorsolateral frontal areas reflecting deficient processing in ADHD (Hart et al., in Hum Brain Mapp 35:3083–3094, 2014), and overlapped with decreased activations in patients in conventional group comparisons. Regions more predictive for ADHD patients were identified in the posterior cingulate, temporal and occipital cortex. Interestingly despite pronounced univariate group differences in inhibition-related activation and grey matter volumes the corresponding classifiers failed or only yielded a poor discrimination. The present study corroborates the potential of task-related brain activation for classification shown in previous studies. It remains to be clarified whether error processing, which performed best here, also contributes to the discrimination of useful dimensions and subtypes, different psychiatric disorders, and prediction of treatment success across studies and sites.}

Technological innovations may improve our ability to reach underserved populations by overcoming many existing barriers. We evaluated a brief, automated risk assessment and intervention platform designed to increase the use of crisis resources provided to those online and in crisis. Method: Participants, users of the digital mental health app Koko, were randomly assigned to treatment or control conditions upon accessing the app and were included in the study after their posts were identified by machine learning classifiers as signaling a current mental health crisis. Participants in the treatment condition received a brief Barrier Reduction Intervention (BRI) designed to increase the use of crisis service referrals provided on the app. Participants were followed up several hours later to assess the use of crisis services. Results: Only about one quarter of participants in a crisis (21.8\%) reported being “very likely” to use clinical referrals provided to them, with the most commonly endorsed barriers being they “just want to chat” or their “thoughts are too intense.” Among participants providing follow-up data (41.3\%), receipt of the BRI was associated with a 23\% increase in the use of crisis services. Conclusion: These findings suggest that a brief, automated BRI can be efficacious on digital platforms, even among individuals experiencing acute psychological distress. The potential to increase help seeking and service utilization with such procedures holds promise for those in need of psychiatric services.

  abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with a wide phenotypic range, often affecting personality and communication. Previous voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies of ASD have identified both gray- and white-matter volume changes. However, the cerebral cortex is a 2-D sheet with a highly folded and curved geometry, which VBM cannot directly measure. Surface-based morphometry (SBM) has the advantage of being able to measure cortical surface features, such as thickness. The goals of this study were twofold: to construct diagnostic models for ASD, based on regional thickness measurements extracted from SBM, and to compare these models to diagnostic models based on volumetric morphometry. Our study included 22 subjects with ASD (mean age 9.2±2.1 years) and 16 volunteer controls (mean age 10.0±1.9 years). Using SBM, we obtained regional cortical thicknesses for 66 brain structures for each subject. In addition, we obtained volumes for the same 66 structures for these subjects. To generate diagnostic models, we employed four machine-learning techniques: support vector machines (SVMs), multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), functional trees (FTs), and logistic model trees (LMTs). We found that thickness-based diagnostic models were superior to those based on regional volumes. For thickness-based classification, LMT achieved the best classification performance, with accuracy=87\%, area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC)=0.93, sensitivity=95\%, and specificity=75\%. For volume-based classification, LMT achieved the highest accuracy, with accuracy=74\%, AUC=0.77, sensitivity=77\%, and specificity=69\%. The thickness-based diagnostic model generated by LMT included 7 structures. Relative to controls, children with ASD had decreased cortical thickness in the left and right pars triangularis, left medial orbitofrontal gyrus, left parahippocampal gyrus, and left frontal pole, and increased cortical thickness in the left caudal anterior cingulate and left precuneus. Overall, thickness-based classification outperformed volume-based classification across a variety of classification methods.},

  abstract = {Autism is widely believed to be a heterogeneous disorder; diagnosis is currently based solely on clinical criteria, although genetic, as well as environmental, influences are thought to be prominent factors in the etiology of most forms of autism. Our goal is to determine whether a predictive model based on single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can predict symptom severity of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We divided 118 ASD children into a mild/moderate autism group (n = 65) and a severe autism group (n = 53), based on the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS). For each child, we obtained 29 SNPs of 9 ASD-related genes. To generate predictive models, we employed three machine-learning techniques: decision stumps (DSs), alternating decision trees (ADTrees), and FlexTrees. DS and FlexTree generated modestly better classifiers, with accuracy = 67\%, sensitivity = 0.88 and specificity = 0.42. The SNP rs878960 in GABRB3 was selected by all models, and was related associated with CARS assessment. Our results suggest that SNPs have the potential to offer accurate classification of ASD symptom severity.},

The errors do not affect the results or conclusions of the study as the final number of meta-analysable studies are the same as originally reported.] A meta-analysis examining temporal changes (time trends) in the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) as a treatment for unipolar depression was conducted. A comprehensive search of psychotherapy trials yielded 70 eligible studies from 1977 to 2014. Effect sizes (ES) were quantified as Hedge’s g based on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD). Rates of remission were also registered. The publication year of each study was examined as a linear metaregression predictor of ES, and as part of a 2-way interaction with other moderators (Year × Moderator). The average ES of the BDI was 1.58 (95\% CI [1.43, 1.74]), and 1.69 for the HRSD (95\% CI [1.48, 1.89]). Subgroup analyses revealed that women profited more from therapy than did men (p {$<$} .05). Experienced psychologists (g = 1.55) achieved better results (p {$<$} .01) than less experienced student therapists (g = 0.98). The metaregressions examining the temporal trends indicated that the effects of CBT have declined linearly and steadily since its introduction, as measured by patients’ self-reports (the BDI, p {$<$} .001), clinicians’ ratings (the HRSD, p {$<$} .01) and rates of remission (p {$<$} .01). Subgroup analyses confirmed that the declining trend was present in both within-group (pre/post) designs (p {$<$} .01) and controlled trial designs (p = .02). Thus, modern CBT clinical trials seemingly provided less relief from depressive symptoms as compared with the seminal trials. Potential causes and possible implications for future studies are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Depression is a prevalent mental disorder that can have a significant impact on people's mental health as well as their day-to-day lives. Depression and mental illness are a key problem in society nowadays. It can cause a loss of interest in general activities that can lead to suicidal thoughts. Hence, the need of an automated system that can help in detecting depression in people of various age groups is being realized. In order to detect depression,Researchers have been looking for approaches to effectively identify depression. A number of studies have been proposed in this regard. Here, In this study, we are analysing various existing studies based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and diverse Machine Learning (ML) techniques being used to detect depression. Apart from it, different approaches used to detect emotion and mood in an individual are discussed. This study analyses how facial expressions, images, emotional chatbots and texts on social media platforms can be effectual in detecting one’s emotions and then depression. Naive-Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Long Term Short Memory (LSTM) – Radial Neural Networks (RNN), Logistic Regression, Linear Support Vector, etc. are the various ML techniques used to recognize emotions from text processing; Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is used for feature extraction and classifications of images to detect emotions through facial expressions. This paper aims to provide the survey of various AI and ML techniques which help in the detection and analysis of emotion and hence depression along with their related research issues.},

Materials and Methods During a national meeting for AI, eHealth, and IT infrastructure in 2019, we conducted a survey to obtain participants’ attitudes. A total of 123 participants completed 28 items exploring AI usage in medicine. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to identify differences between radiologists, IT specialists, and industry representatives. Results The strongest agreement between all respondents occurred with the following: plausibility checks are important to understand the decisions of the AI (93\% agreement), validation of AI algorithms is mandatory (91\%), and medicine becomes more efficient in the age of AI (86\%). In contrast, only 25\% of the respondents had confidence in the AI results, and only 17\% believed that medicine will become more human through the use of AI. The answers were significantly different between the three professions for four items: relevance for protocol selection in cross-sectional imaging (p = 0.034), medical societies should be involved in validation (p = 0.028), patients should be informed about the use of AI (p = 0.047), and AI should be part of medical education (p = 0.026). Conclusion Currently, a discrepancy exists between high expectations for the future role of AI and low confidence in the results. This attitude was similar across all three groups. The demand for plausibility checks and the need to prove the usefulness in randomized controlled studies indicate what is needed in future research.}

  abstract = {Summary             Progress in developing personalised care for mental disorders is supported by numerous proof-of-concept machine learning studies in the area of risk assessment, diagnostics and precision prescribing. Most of these studies primarily use clinical data, but models might benefit from additional neuroimaging, blood and genetic data to improve accuracy. Combined, multimodal models might offer potential for stratification of patients for treatment. Clinical implementation of machine learning is impeded by a lack of wider generalisability, with efforts primarily focused on psychosis and dementia. Studies across all diagnostic groups should work to test the robustness of machine learning models, which is an essential first step to clinical implementation, and then move to prospective clinical validation. Models need to exceed clinicians’ heuristics to be useful, and safe, in routine decision-making. Engagement of clinicians, researchers and patients in digitalisation and ‘big data’ approaches are vital to allow the generation and accessibility of large, longitudinal, prospective data needed for precision psychiatry to be applied into real-world psychiatric care.},

However, it is very likely that AI applications will acquire many of their roles and generate new tasks in medical care. To be ready for new roles and tasks, medical students and physicians will need to understand the fundamentals of AI and data science, mathematical concepts, and related ethical and medico-legal issues in addition with the standard medical principles. Nevertheless, there is no valid and reliable instrument available in the literature to measure medical AI readiness. In this study, we have described the development of a valid and reliable psychometric measurement tool for the assessment of the perceived readiness of medical students on AI technologies and its applications in medicine.                                            Methods                To define medical students’ required competencies on AI, a diverse set of experts’ opinions were obtained by a qualitative method and were used as a theoretical framework, while creating the item pool of the scale. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) were applied.                                            Results                                  A total of 568 medical students during the EFA phase and 329 medical students during the CFA phase, enrolled in two different public universities in Turkey participated in this study. The initial 27-items finalized with a 22-items scale in a four-factor structure (cognition, ability, vision, and ethics), which explains 50.9\% cumulative variance that resulted from the EFA. Cronbach’s alpha reliability coefficient was 0.87. CFA indicated appropriate fit of the four-factor model (                  χ                                      2                                    /df                  \,=\,3.81, RMSEA\,=\,0.094, SRMR\,=\,0.057, CFI\,=\,0.938, and NNFI (TLI)\,=\,0.928).

Conclusions                The newly developed Medical Artificial Intelligence Readiness Scale for Medical Students (MAIRS-MS) was found to be valid and reliable tool for evaluation and monitoring of perceived readiness levels of medical students on AI technologies and applications.                Medical schools may follow ‘a physician training perspective that is compatible with AI in medicine’ to their curricula by using MAIRS-MS. This scale could be benefitted by medical and health science education institutions as a valuable curriculum development tool with its learner needs assessment and participants’ end-course perceived readiness opportunities.},

  abstract = {Background. It is well known that web-based interventions can be effective treatments for depression. However, dropout rates in web-based interventions are typically high, especially in self-guided web-based interventions. Rigorous empirical evidence regarding factors influencing dropout in self-guided web-based interventions is lacking due to small study sample sizes. In this paper we examined predictors of dropout in an individual patient data meta-analysis to gain a better understanding of who may benefit from these interventions. Method. A comprehensive literature search for all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of psychotherapy for adults with depression from 2006 to January 2013 was conducted. Next, we approached authors to collect the primary data of the selected studies. Predictors of dropout, such as socio-demographic, clinical, and intervention characteristics were examined. Results. Data from 2705 participants across ten RCTs of self-guided web-based interventions for depression were analysed. The multivariate analysis indicated that male gender [relative risk (RR) 1.08], lower educational level (primary education, RR 1.26) and co-morbid anxiety symptoms (RR 1.18) significantly increased the risk of dropping out, while for every additional 4 years of age, the risk of dropping out significantly decreased (RR 0.94). Conclusions. Dropout can be predicted by several variables and is not randomly distributed. This knowledge may inform tailoring of online self-help interventions to prevent dropout in identified groups at risk.},

However, there are currently limited examples of such techniques being successfully deployed into clinical practice. This article explores the main challenges and limitations of AI in healthcare, and considers the steps required to translate these potentially transformative technologies from research to clinical practice.                                         Main body               Key challenges for the translation of AI systems in healthcare include those intrinsic to the science of machine learning, logistical difficulties in implementation, and consideration of the barriers to adoption as well as of the necessary sociocultural or pathway changes. Robust peer-reviewed clinical evaluation as part of randomised controlled trials should be viewed as the gold standard for evidence generation, but conducting these in practice may not always be appropriate or feasible. Performance metrics should aim to capture real clinical applicability and be understandable to intended users. Regulation that balances the pace of innovation with the potential for harm, alongside thoughtful post-market surveillance, is required to ensure that patients are not exposed to dangerous interventions nor deprived of access to beneficial innovations. Mechanisms to enable direct comparisons of AI systems must be developed, including the use of independent, local and representative test sets. Developers of AI algorithms must be vigilant to potential dangers, including dataset shift, accidental fitting of confounders, unintended discriminatory bias, the challenges of generalisation to new populations, and the unintended negative consequences of new algorithms on health outcomes.                                         Conclusion               The safe and timely translation of AI research into clinically validated and appropriately regulated systems that can benefit everyone is challenging. Robust clinical evaluation, using metrics that are intuitive to clinicians and ideally go beyond measures of technical accuracy to include quality of care and patient outcomes, is essential. Further work is required (1) to identify themes of algorithmic bias and unfairness while developing mitigations to address these, (2) to reduce brittleness and improve generalisability, and (3) to develop methods for improved interpretability of machine learning predictions. If these goals can be achieved, the benefits for patients are likely to be transformational.},

  abstract = {Leading biological hypotheses propose that biological changes may underlie major depressive disorder onset and relapse/recurrence. Here, we investigate if there is prospective evidence for biomarkers derived from leading theories. We focus on neuroimaging, gastrointestinal factors, immunology, neurotrophic factors, neurotransmitters, hormones, and oxidative stress. Searches were performed in Pubmed, Embase and PsychInfo for articles published up to 06/2019. References and citations of included articles were screened to identify additional articles. Inclusion criteria were having an MDD diagnosis as outcome, a biomarker as predictor, and prospective design search terms were formulated accordingly. PRISMA guidelines were applied. Meta-analyses were performed using a random effect model when three or more comparable studies were identified, using a random effect model. Our search resulted in 67,464 articles, of which 75 prospective articles were identified on: Neuroimaging (N\,=\,24), Gastrointestinal factors (N\,=\,1), Immunology (N\,=\,8), Neurotrophic (N\,=\,2), Neurotransmitters (N\,=\,1), Hormones (N\,=\,39), Oxidative stress (N\,=\,1). Meta-analyses on brain volumes and immunology markers were not significant. Only cortisol (N\,=\,19, OR\,=\,1.294, p\,=\,0.024) showed a predictive effect on onset/relapse/recurrence of MDD, but not on time until MDD onset/relapse/recurrence. However, this effect disappeared when studies including participants with a baseline clinical diagnosis were removed from the analyses. Other studies were too heterogeneous to compare. Thus, there is a lack of evidence for leading biological theories for onset and maintenance of depression. Only cortisol was identified as potential predictor for MDD, but results are influenced by the disease state. High-quality (prospective) studies on MDD are needed to disentangle the etiology and maintenance of MDD.},

In addition, this study examines the moderating role of knowledge in these relationships. Design/methodology/approach The researchers collected data via online surveys to reach the target population of this study, 55 years and older adults who had used mobile devices for tourism. The researchers used the partial least squares approach for this study. Findings The results reveal that ease of use has significant effects on extrinsic and intrinsic motivations. The motivations of usefulness and enjoyment significantly affect attachment, which, in turn, influences usage intention. The relationships between ease of use and usefulness, ease of use and enjoyment and enjoyment and attachment were stronger for the high-knowledge group than for the low-knowledge group. The relationship between usefulness and attachment was stronger for the low-knowledge group than for the high-knowledge group. Research limitations/implications The findings of this study provide compelling implications for academics and practitioners in the senior tourism field. Originality/value The compelling insight of this study is the development of a research model that combines an emergent construct of attachment as a mediator and knowledge of technology as a moderator.},

The number and list of colors used, the area of each color painted, the blend of colors, etc., are common elements rated in the evaluation of art. The main color in a drawing is also a major concern in evaluation. This paper delineates the development of a computer system that judges the main color in a drawing by applying the methods available in the field of digital image processing. Often, the main color is a different one from the color with the largest area painted, which is usually a background color. The system devises an algorithm, a kind of artificial intelligence function, to judge the main color as human experts do based on the characteristics, number of pixels, and number of clusters in a drawing. The proposed system is verified through case studies, by comparing the judgments by the computer with those by the human raters. It can contribute to the quantification and objectification of human decisions, as well as reducing the time and effort of human raters, and can therefore be a useful tool and an aid for human experts in making decisions in art therapy.},

This study aimed to detect cerebral hemorrhages and their locations in images using a deep learning model applying explainable deep learning. Normal brain images with no hemorrhages and images with subarachnoid, intraventricular, subdural, epidural, and intraparenchymal hemorrhages according to computed tomography (CT) (n\,=\,200) were analyzed. A ResNet deep learning model, including image processing, was utilized. The visual explanation from a heatmap was made at the hemorrhage location using a gradient-class activation map (Grad-CAM). To evaluate the performance of the deep learning system, the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were determined. A hemorrhage prediction system for images of normal brains and brains with subarachnoid, intraventricular, subdural, epidural, and intraparenchymal hemorrhages was built. The Grad-CAM representation indicated the location of the hemorrhages in these images. In the prediction results, accurate predictions of the hemorrhage areas were made and visualizations of the corresponding locations overlapped in the images within (−\,4, 1) pixel difference. The evaluation of the system performance showed an accuracy of 0.81 with a sensitivity of 0.67 and specificity of 0.86. These results constitue a proof of concept for the use of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to detect cerebral hemorrhages and visualize their locations in medical images, which will allow rapid diagnosis and treatment.},

  abstract = {Background: Digital health apps are efficacious treatment options for mild-to-moderate depressive disorders. However, the extent to which psychological guidance increases the efficacy of these apps is controversial. Objective: We evaluated the efficacy of a web-based intervention, called Selfapy, for unipolar depression. We also investigated differences between psychotherapist-guided and unguided versions. Methods: Selfapy is a cognitive behavioral therapy–based intervention for depressive disorders. Participants with mild-to-severe depressive disorders were assigned randomly to participate in either guided (weekly 25-minute duration telephone calls) intervention, unguided version, or waiting list (control group) for 12 weeks. We assessed depressive symptoms at the start of the study, midway through the intervention (6 weeks), at the end of the intervention (12 weeks), and at follow-up (6 months). The main outcome was difference in the Beck Depression Inventory score between the start of the study and the end of the intervention. Secondary outcomes were the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology—Self Report, the Hamilton Rating Depression Scale, and the Beck Anxiety Inventory. Results: Of 401 participants, 301 participants (75.1\%) completed the intervention. Changes in the Beck Depression Inventory from baseline differed significantly between groups at the postintervention (F2,398=37.20, P\&lt;.001). The reductions in scores for both guided and unguided intervention groups were greater than that for the control group, with large between-group effect sizes (guided vs control: d=1.63, 95\% CI 1.37 to 1.93; unguided vs control: d=1.47, 95\% CI 1.22 to 1.73) at postintervention. No significant differences were found between guided and unguided intervention groups (P=.18). At follow-up (6 months), treatment effects on the primary outcome were maintained for both intervention groups (guided: F1,194=0.62, P\&gt;.999; unguided: F1,176=0.13, P\&gt;.999). Conclusions: Both guided and unguided versions of the intervention were highly effective in reducing depressive symptoms. Follow-up data suggest that these effects could be maintained. The guided version was not superior to the unguided version. Trial Registration: German Clinical Trials Register DRKS00017191; https://tinyurl.com/2p9h5hnx},

Project In 1999, a small group of regional information technology (IT) leaders for four community hospitals operated by the Cleveland Clinic Health System in the East Region developed a project for the implementation of computerized physician order management (CPOM). Results Huron Hospital, the first hospital selected for implementation, met its goals for a successful transition. After two pilots, implementation occurred on schedule and with a noticeable lack of major issues, both during rollout and thereafter. In addition, physician direct entry of orders reached the first-year goal of 40\% physician entry in the first month and 75\% within a year.

  abstract = {Mixed-effects models are a powerful tool for modeling fixed and random effects simultaneously, but do not offer a feasible analytic solution for estimating the probability that a test correctly rejects the null hypothesis. Being able to estimate this probability, however, is critical for sample size planning, as power is closely linked to the reliability and replicability of empirical findings. A flexible and very intuitive alternative to analytic power solutions are simulation-based power analyses. Although various tools for conducting simulation-based power analyses for mixed-effects models are available, there is lack of guidance on how to appropriately use them. In this tutorial, we discuss how to estimate power for mixed-effects models in different use cases: first, how to use models that were fit on available (e.g. published) data to determine sample size; second, how to determine the number of stimuli required for sufficient power; and finally, how to conduct sample size planning without available data. Our examples cover both linear and generalized linear models and we provide code and resources for performing simulation-based power analyses on openly accessible data sets. The present work therefore helps researchers to navigate sound research design when using mixed-effects models, by summarizing resources, collating available knowledge, providing solutions and tools, and applying them to real-world problems in sample sizing planning when sophisticated analysis procedures like mixed-effects models are outlined as inferential procedures.},

Google Play and iTunes were searched for apps related to depression, self-harm, substance use, anxiety, and schizophrenia. The descriptions of the top-ranking, consumer-focused apps were coded to identify claims of acceptability and effectiveness, and forms of supporting statement. For apps which invoked ostensibly scientific principles, a literature search was conducted to assess their credibility. Seventy-three apps were coded, and the majority (64\%) claimed effectiveness at diagnosing a mental health condition, or improving symptoms, mood or self-management. Scientific language was most frequently used to support these effectiveness claims (44\%), although this included techniques not validated by literature searches (8/24\,=\,33\%). Two apps described low-quality, primary evidence to support the use of the app. Only one app included a citation to published literature. A minority of apps (14\%) described design or development involving lived experience, and none referenced certification or accreditation processes such as app libraries. Scientific language was the most frequently invoked form of support for use of mental health apps; however, high-quality evidence is not commonly described. Improved knowledge translation strategies may improve the adoption of other strategies, such as certification or lived experience co-design.},

Methods: We conducted a systematic search of articles published in PubMed using a predefined set of queries that identified 99 potential articles for review. These articles were screened according to topic relevance and 14 were selected for consideration as best paper candidates. The 14 papers were then presented to a panel of international experts for full paper review and scoring. Three papers that received the highest score were discussed in a consensus meeting and were agreed upon as best papers on artificial intelligence in health for patients and consumers in the year 2018.   Results: Only a small number of 2018 papers reported Artificial Intelligence (AI) research for patients and consumers. No studies were found on AI applications designed specifically for patients or consumers, nor were there studies that elicited patient and consumer input on AI. Currently, the most common use of AI for patients and consumers lies in secondary analysis of social media data (e.g., online discussion forums). In particular, the three best papers shared a common methodology of using data-driven algorithms (such as text mining, topic modelling, Latent Dirichlet allocation modelling), combined with insight-led approaches (e.g., visualisation, qualitative analysis and manual review), to uncover patient and consumer experiences of health and illness in online communities.   Conclusions: While discussion remains active on how AI could 'revolutionise' healthcare delivery, there is a lack of direction and evidence on how AI could actually benefit patients and consumers. Perhaps instead of primarily focusing on data and algorithms, researchers should engage with patients and consumers early in the AI research agenda to ensure we are indeed asking the right questions, and that important use cases and critical contexts are identified together with patients and consumers. Without a clear understanding on why patients and consumers need AI in the first place, or how AI could support individuals with their healthcare needs, it is difficult to imagine the kinds of AI applications that would have meaningful and sustainable impact on individual daily lives.},

In addition, AI systems are making an impact on improving the efficiency of nursing and managerial activities of hospitals. While AI is being embraced positively by healthcare providers, its applications provide both the utopian perspective (new opportunities) and the dystopian view (challenges to overcome). We discuss the details of those opportunities and challenges to provide a balanced view of the value of AI applications in healthcare. It is clear that rapid advances of AI and related technologies will help care providers create new value for their patients and improve the efficiency of their operational processes.

  abstract = {Background No previous study has comprehensively reviewed the application of machine learning algorithms in mood disorders populations. Herein, we qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate previous studies of machine learning-devised models that predict therapeutic outcomes in mood disorders populations. Methods We searched Ovid MEDLINE/PubMed from inception to February 8, 2018 for relevant studies that included adults with bipolar or unipolar depression; assessed therapeutic outcomes with a pharmacological, neuromodulatory, or manual-based psychotherapeutic intervention for depression; applied a machine learning algorithm; and reported predictors of therapeutic response. A random-effects meta-analysis of proportions and meta-regression analyses were conducted. Results We identified 639 records: 75 full-text publications were assessed for eligibility; 26 studies (n=17,499) and 20 studies (n=6325) were included in qualitative and quantitative review, respectively. Classification algorithms were able to predict therapeutic outcomes with an overall accuracy of 0.82 (95\% confidence interval [CI] of [0.77, 0.87]). Pooled estimates of classification accuracy were significantly greater (p\,{$<$}\,0.01) in models informed by multiple data types (e.g., composite of phenomenological patient features and neuroimaging or peripheral gene expression data; pooled proportion [95\% CI] = 0.93[0.86, 0.97]) when compared to models with lower-dimension data types (pooledproportion=0.68[0.62,0.74]to0.85[0.81,0.88]). Limitations Most studies were retrospective; differences in machine learning algorithms and their implementation (e.g., cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning); cannot infer importance of individual variables fed into learning algorithm. Conclusions Machine learning algorithms provide a powerful conceptual and analytic framework capable of integrating multiple data types and sources. An integrative approach may more effectively model neurobiological components as functional modules of pathophysiology embedded within the complex, social dynamics that influence the phenomenology of mental disorders.},

  abstract = {Owing to improvements in image recognition via deep learning, machine-learning algorithms could eventually be applied to automated medical diagnoses that can guide clinical decision-making. However, these algorithms remain a ‘black box’ in terms of how they generate the predictions from the input data. Also, high-performance deep learning requires large, high-quality training datasets. Here, we report the development of an understandable deep-learning system that detects acute intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) and classifies five ICH subtypes from unenhanced head computed-tomography scans. By using a dataset of only 904 cases for algorithm training, the system achieved a performance similar to that of expert radiologists in two independent test datasets containing 200 cases (sensitivity of 98\% and specificity of 95\%) and 196 cases (sensitivity of 92\% and specificity of 95\%). The system includes an attention map and a prediction basis retrieved from training data to enhance explainability, and an iterative process that mimics the workflow of radiologists. Our approach to algorithm development can facilitate the development of deep-learning systems for a variety of clinical applications and accelerate their adoption into clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in variety of areas has encouraged an extensive global discourse on the underlying ethical principles and values. With the rapid AI development process and its near instant global coverage, the issues of applicable ethical principles and guidelines have become vital. AI promises to deliver a lot of advantages to economic, social and educational fields. Since AI is also increasingly applied in healthcare and medical education areas, ethical application issues are growing ever more important. Ethical and social issues raised by AI in healthcare overlap with those raised by personal data use, function automation, reliance on assistive medical technologies and the so-called ‘telehealth’. Without well-grounded ethical guidelines or even regulatory framework in respect of the AI in healthcare several legal and ethical problems at the implementational level can arise. In order to facilitate further discussion about the ethical principles and responsibilities of educational system in healthcare using AI and to potentially arrive at a consensus concerning safe and desirable uses of AI in healthcare education, this paper performs an evaluation of the self-imposed AI ethical guidelines identifying the common principles and approaches as well as drawbacks limiting the practical and legal application of internal policies. The main aim of the research is to encourage integration of theoretical studies and policy studies on sustainability issues in correlation between healthcare and technologies, the AI ethical perspective.},

  abstract = {Background: Digital health has the potential to support care delivery for chronic illness. Despite positive evidence from localized implementations, new technologies have proven slow to become accepted, integrated, and routinized at scale. Objective: The aim of our study was to examine barriers and facilitators to implementation of digital health at scale through the evaluation of a £37m national digital health program: ‟Delivering Assisted Living Lifestyles at Scale” (dallas) from 2012-2015. Methods: The study was a longitudinal qualitative, multi-stakeholder, implementation study. The methods included interviews (n=125) with key implementers, focus groups with consumers and patients (n=7), project meetings (n=12), field work or observation in the communities (n=16), health professional survey responses (n=48), and cross program documentary evidence on implementation (n=215). We used a sociological theory called normalization process theory (NPT) and a longitudinal (3 years) qualitative framework analysis approach. This work did not study a single intervention or population. Instead, we evaluated the processes (of designing and delivering digital health), and our outcomes were the identified barriers and facilitators to delivering and mainstreaming services and products within the mixed sector digital health ecosystem. Results: We identified three main levels of issues influencing readiness for digital health: macro (market, infrastructure, policy), meso (organizational), and micro (professional or public). Factors hindering implementation included: lack of information technology (IT) infrastructure, uncertainty around information governance, lack of incentives to prioritize interoperability, lack of precedence on accountability within the commercial sector, and a market perceived as difficult to navigate. Factors enabling implementation were: clinical endorsement, champions who promoted digital health, and public and professional willingness. Conclusions: Although there is receptiveness to digital health, barriers to mainstreaming remain. Our findings suggest greater investment in national and local infrastructure, implementation of guidelines for the safe and transparent use and assessment of digital health, incentivization of interoperability, and investment in upskilling of professionals and the public would help support the normalization of digital health. These findings will enable researchers, health care practitioners, and policy makers to understand the current landscape and the actions required in order to prepare the market and accelerate uptake, and use of digital health and wellness services in context and at scale.},

  abstract = {Recent research has shown that social anxiety disorder (SAD) is accompanied by abnormalities in brain functional connections. However, these findings are based on group comparisons, and, therefore, little is known about whether functional connections could be used in the diagnosis of an individual patient with SAD. Here, we explored the potential of the functional connectivity to be used for SAD diagnosis. Twenty patients with SAD and 20 healthy controls were scanned using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. The whole brain was divided into 116 regions based on automated anatomical labeling atlas. The functional connectivity between each pair of regions was computed using Pearson’s correlation coefficient and used as classification feature. Multivariate pattern analysis was then used to classify patients from healthy controls. The pattern classifier was designed using linear support vector machine. Experimental results showed a correct classification rate of 82.5~\% (p~{$<~$}0.001) with sensitivity of 85.0~\% and specificity of 80.0~\%, using a leave-one-out cross-validation method. It was found that the consensus connections used to distinguish SAD were largely located within or across the default mode network, visual network, sensory-motor network, affective network, and cerebellar regions. Specifically, the right orbitofrontal region exhibited the highest weight in classification. The current study demonstrated that functional connectivity had good diagnostic potential for SAD, thus providing evidence for the possible use of whole brain functional connectivity as a complementary tool in clinical diagnosis. In addition, this study confirmed previous work and described novel pathophysiological mechanisms of SAD.},

The present study examined whether their face scanning patterns could be potentially useful to identify children with ASD by adopting the machine learning algorithm for the classification purpose. Particularly, we applied the machine learning method to analyze an eye movement dataset from a face recognition task [Yi et al., 2016], to classify children with and without ASD. We evaluated the performance of our model in terms of its accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of classifying ASD. Results indicated promising evidence for applying the machine learning algorithm based on the face scanning patterns to identify children with ASD, with a maximum classification accuracy of 88.51\%. Nevertheless, our study is still preliminary with some constraints that may apply in the clinical practice. Future research should shed light on further valuation of our method and contribute to the development of a multitask and multimodel approach to aid the process of early detection and diagnosis of ASD.

However, patients with mental illnesses who present similar behavior may be diagnosed differently, which is why a personalized study of each patient is necessary. Following previous promising results in the detection of depression, in this work, supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms were applied to classify the different states of patients diagnosed with bipolar depressive disorder (BDD). The purpose of this study was to provide relevant information to medical staff and patients’ relatives in order to help them make decisions that may lead to a better management of the disease. The information used was collected from BDD patients through wearable devices (smartwatches), daily self-reports, and medical observation at regular appointments. The variables were processed and then statistical techniques of data analysis, normalization, noise reduction, and feature selection were applied. An individual analysis of each patient was carried out. Random Forest, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine algorithms were applied with different configurations. The results allowed us to draw some conclusions. Random Forest achieved the most accurate classification, but none of the applied models were the best technique for all patients. Besides, the classification using only selected variables produced better results than using all available information, though the amount and source of the relevant variables differed for each patient. Finally, the smartwatch was the most relevant source of information.},

  abstract = {Background Depression is frequent in panic disorder (PD); yet, little is known about its influence on the neural substrates of PD. Difficulties in fear inhibition during safety signal processing have been reported as a pathophysiological feature of PD that is attenuated by depression. We investigated the impact of comorbid depression in PD with agoraphobia (AG) on the neural correlates of fear conditioning and the potential of machine learning to predict comorbidity status on the individual patient level based on neural characteristics. Methods Fifty-nine PD/AG patients including 26 (44\%) with a comorbid depressive disorder (PD/AG+DEP) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Comorbidity status was predicted using a random undersampling tree ensemble in a leave-one-out cross-validation framework. Results PD/AG−DEP patients showed altered neural activation during safety signal processing, while +DEP patients exhibited generally decreased dorsolateral prefrontal and insular activation. Comorbidity status was correctly predicted in 79\% of patients (sensitivity: 73\%; specificity: 85\%) based on brain activation during fear conditioning (corrected for potential confounders: accuracy: 73\%; sensitivity: 77\%; specificity: 70\%). Limitations No primary depressed patients were available; only medication-free patients were included. Major depression and dysthymia were collapsed (power considerations). Conclusions Neurofunctional activation during safety signal processing differed between patients with or without comorbid depression, a finding which may explain heterogeneous results across previous studies. These findings demonstrate the relevance of comorbidity when investigating neurofunctional substrates of anxiety disorders. Predicting individual comorbidity status may translate neurofunctional data into clinically relevant information which might aid in planning individualized treatment.

  abstract = {Background: Mental health disorders affect 1 in 10 people globally, of whom approximately 300 million are affected by depression. At least half of the people affected by depression remain untreated. Although cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment, access to mental health specialists, habitually challenging, has worsened because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Internet-based CBT is an effective and feasible strategy to increase access to treatment for people with depression. Mental health apps may further assist in facilitating self-management for people affected by depression; however, accessing the correct app may be cumbersome given the large number and wide variety of apps offered by public app marketplaces. Objective: This study aims to systematically assess the features, functionality, data security, and congruence with evidence of self-guided CBT-based apps targeting users affected by depression that are available in major app stores. Methods: We conducted a systematic assessment of self-guided CBT-based apps available in Google Play and the Apple App Store. Apps launched or updated since August 2018 were identified through a systematic search in the 42matters database using CBT-related terms. Apps meeting the inclusion criteria were downloaded and assessed using a Samsung Galaxy J7 Pro (Android 9) and iPhone 7 (iOS 13.3.1). Apps were appraised using a 182-question checklist developed by the research team, assessing their general characteristics, technical aspects and quality assurance, and CBT-related features, including 6 evidence-based CBT techniques (ie, psychoeducation, behavioral activation, cognitive restructuring, problem solving, relaxation, and exposure for comorbid anxiety) as informed by a CBT manual, CBT competence framework, and a literature review of internet-based CBT clinical trial protocols. The results were reported as a narrative review using descriptive statistics. Results: The initial search yielded 3006 apps, of which 98 met the inclusion criteria and were systematically assessed. There were 20 well-being apps; 65 mental health apps, targeting two or more common mental health disorders, including depression; and 13 depression apps. A total of 28 apps offered at least four evidence-based CBT techniques, particularly depression apps. Cognitive restructuring was the most common technique, offered by 79\% (77/98) of the apps. Only one-third of the apps offered suicide risk management resources, whereas 17\% (17/98) of the apps offered COVID-19–related information. Although most apps included a privacy policy, only a third of the apps presented it before account creation. In total, 82\% (74/90) of privacy policies stated sharing data with third-party service providers. Half of the app development teams included academic institutions or health care providers. Conclusions: Only a few self-guided CBT-based apps offer comprehensive CBT programs or suicide risk management resources. Sharing of users’ data is widespread, highlighting shortcomings in health app market governance. To fulfill their potential, self-guided CBT-based apps should follow evidence-based clinical guidelines, be patient centered, and enhance users’ data security. Trial Registration:},

Objective smartphone-collected data may contain sufficient information about individuals’ behaviors to infer their mental states and therefore screen for anxiety disorders and depression. Objective: The objective of this study is to compare how a single set of recognized and novel features, extracted from smartphone-collected data, can be used for predicting generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), and depression. Methods: An Android app was designed, together with a centralized server system, to collect periodic measurements of objective smartphone data. The types of data included samples of ambient audio, GPS location, screen state, and light sensor data. Subjects were recruited into a 2-week observational study in which the app was run on their personal smartphones. The subjects also completed self-report severity measures of SAD, GAD, and depression. The participants were 112 Canadian adults from a nonclinical population. High-level features were extracted from the data of 84 participants, and predictive models of SAD, GAD, and depression were built and evaluated. Results: Models of SAD and depression achieved a significantly greater screening accuracy than uninformative models (area under the receiver operating characteristic means of 0.64, SD 0.13 and 0.72, SD 0.12, respectively), whereas models of GAD failed to be predictive. Investigation of the model coefficients revealed key features that were predictive of SAD and depression. Conclusions: We demonstrate the ability of a common set of features to act as predictors in the models of both SAD and depression. This suggests that the types of behaviors that can be inferred from smartphone-collected data are broad indicators of mental health, which can be used to study, assess, and track psychopathology simultaneously across multiple disorders and diagnostic boundaries.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Recently developed machine-learning algorithms have demonstrated strong performance in the detection of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and large vessel occlusion (LVO). However, their generalizability is often limited by geographic bias of studies. The aim of this study was to validate a commercially available deep learning-based tool in the detection of both ICH and LVO across multiple hospital sites and vendors throughout the U.S.Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective and multicenter study using anonymized data from two institutions. Eight hundred fourteen non-contrast CT cases and 378 CT angiography cases were analyzed to evaluate ICH and LVO, respectively. The tool's ability to detect and quantify ICH, LVO, and their various subtypes was assessed among multiple CT vendors and hospitals across the United States. Ground truth was based off imaging interpretations from two board-certified neuroradiologists.Results: There were 255 positive and 559 negative ICH cases. Accuracy was 95.6\%, sensitivity was 91.4\%, and specificity was 97.5\% for the ICH tool. ICH was further stratified into the following subtypes: intraparenchymal, intraventricular, epidural/subdural, and subarachnoid with true positive rates of 92.9, 100, 94.3, and 89.9\%, respectively. ICH true positive rates by volume [small ({$<$}5 mL), medium (5–25 mL), and large ({$>$}25 mL)] were 71.8, 100, and 100\%, respectively. There were 156 positive and 222 negative LVO cases. The LVO tool demonstrated an accuracy of 98.1\%, sensitivity of 98.1\%, and specificity of 98.2\%. A subset of 55 randomly selected cases were also assessed for LVO detection at various sites, including the distal internal carotid artery, middle cerebral artery M1 segment, proximal middle cerebral artery M2 segment, and distal middle cerebral artery M2 segment with an accuracy of 97.0\%, sensitivity of 94.3\%, and specificity of 97.4\%.Conclusion: Deep learning tools can be effective in the detection of both ICH and LVO across a wide variety of hospital systems. While some limitations were identified, specifically in the detection of small ICH and distal M2 occlusion, this study highlights a deep learning tool that can assist radiologists in the detection of emergent findings in a variety of practice settings.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can be reliably diagnosed at 18 months, yet significant diagnostic delays persist in the United States. This double-blinded, multi-site, prospective, active comparator cohort study tested the accuracy of an artificial intelligence-based Software as a Medical Device designed to aid primary care healthcare providers (HCPs) in diagnosing ASD. The Device combines behavioral features from three distinct inputs (a caregiver questionnaire, analysis of two short home videos, and an HCP questionnaire) in a gradient boosted decision tree machine learning algorithm to produce either an ASD positive, ASD negative, or indeterminate output. This study compared Device outputs to diagnostic agreement by two or more independent specialists in a cohort of 18–72-month-olds with developmental delay concerns (425 study completers, 36\% female, 29\% ASD prevalence). Device output PPV for all study completers was 80.8\% (95\% confidence intervals (CI), 70.3\%–88.8\%) and NPV was 98.3\% (90.6\%–100\%). For the 31.8\% of participants who received a determinate output (ASD positive or negative) Device sensitivity was 98.4\% (91.6\%–100\%) and specificity was 78.9\% (67.6\%–87.7\%). The Device’s indeterminate output acts as a risk control measure when inputs are insufficiently granular to make a determinate recommendation with confidence. If this risk control measure were removed, the sensitivity for all study completers would fall to 51.6\% (63/122) (95\% CI 42.4\%, 60.8\%), and specificity would fall to 18.5\% (56/303) (95\% CI 14.3\%, 23.3\%). Among participants for whom the Device abstained from providing a result, specialists identified that 91\% had one or more complex neurodevelopmental disorders. No significant differences in Device performance were found across participants’ sex, race/ethnicity, income, or education level. For nearly a third of this primary care sample, the Device enabled timely diagnostic evaluation with a high degree of accuracy. The Device shows promise to significantly increase the number of children able to be diagnosed with ASD in a primary care setting, potentially facilitating earlier intervention and more efficient use of specialist resources.},

AI's future role in medical practice remains an unanswered question. Machines (computers) learn to detect patterns not decipherable using biostatistics by processing massive datasets (big data) through layered mathematical models (algorithms). Correcting algorithm mistakes (training) adds to AI predictive model confidence. AI is being successfully applied for image analysis in radiology, pathology, and dermatology, with diagnostic speed exceeding, and accuracy paralleling, medical experts. While diagnostic confidence never reaches 100\%, combining machines plus physicians reliably enhances system performance. Cognitive programs are impacting medical practice by applying natural language processing to read the rapidly expanding scientific literature and collate years of diverse electronic medical records. In this and other ways, AI may optimize the care trajectory of chronic disease patients, suggest precision therapies for complex illnesses, reduce medical errors, and improve subject enrollment into clinical trials.},

In manufacturing, AI can help design better products in terms of functionality, quality, and cost, and improve predictive maintenance. AI can help extend credit and financial services to those who lack them. The potential impact of AI on transportation and logistics goes far beyond automation and road safety to span the entire logistics chain.

Data sources PubMed from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2019. Eligibility criteria Articles reporting on the development, with or without external validation, of a multivariable prediction model (diagnostic or prognostic) developed using supervised machine learning for individualised predictions. No restrictions applied for study design, data source, or predicted patient related health outcomes. Review methods Methodological quality of the studies was determined and risk of bias evaluated using the prediction risk of bias assessment tool (PROBAST). This tool contains 21 signalling questions tailored to identify potential biases in four domains. Risk of bias was measured for each domain (participants, predictors, outcome, and analysis) and each study (overall). Results 152 studies were included: 58 (38\%) included a diagnostic prediction model and 94 (62\%) a prognostic prediction model. PROBAST was applied to 152 developed models and 19 external validations. Of these 171 analyses, 148 (87\%, 95\% confidence interval 81\% to 91\%) were rated at high risk of bias. The analysis domain was most frequently rated at high risk of bias. Of the 152 models, 85 (56\%, 48\% to 64\%) were developed with an inadequate number of events per candidate predictor, 62 handled missing data inadequately (41\%, 33\% to 49\%), and 59 assessed overfitting improperly (39\%, 31\% to 47\%). Most models used appropriate data sources to develop (73\%, 66\% to 79\%) and externally validate the machine learning based prediction models (74\%, 51\% to 88\%). Information about blinding of outcome and blinding of predictors was, however, absent in 60 (40\%, 32\% to 47\%) and 79 (52\%, 44\% to 60\%) of the developed models, respectively. Conclusion Most studies on machine learning based prediction models show poor methodological quality and are at high risk of bias. Factors contributing to risk of bias include small study size, poor handling of missing data, and failure to deal with overfitting. Efforts to improve the design, conduct, reporting, and validation of such studies are necessary to boost the application of machine learning based prediction models in clinical practice.

The algorithm was introduced in three phases: (a)                             as a “pop-up” widget on ancillary monitors,                                 (b) as a marked examination in reading worklists,                             and (c) as a marked examination for reprioritization                             based on the presence of the flag. A statistical approach, which was                             based on a queuing theory, was implemented to assess the impact of each                             intervention on queue-adjusted wait and turnaround time compared with                             historical controls.ResultsNotification with a widget or flagging the examination had no effect on                             queue-adjusted image wait (P {$>$} .99) or turnaround                             time (P = .6). However, a reduction in                             queue-adjusted wait time was observed between negative (15.45 minutes;                             95\% CI: 15.07, 15.38) and positive (12.02 minutes; 95\% CI: 11.06, 12.97;                                 P {$<$} .0001) artificial                             intelligence–detected ICH examinations with reprioritization.

  abstract = {Amid electronic health records, laboratory tests, and other technology, office-based patient and provider communication is still the heart of primary medical care. Patients typically present multiple complaints, requiring physicians to decide how to balance competing demands. How this time is allocated has implications for patient satisfaction, payments, and quality of care. We investigate the effectiveness of machine learning methods for automated annotation of medical topics in patient-provider dialog transcripts.We used dialog transcripts from 279 primary care visits to predict talk-turn topic labels. Different machine learning models were trained to operate on single or multiple local talk-turns (logistic classifiers, support vector machines, gated recurrent units) as well as sequential models that integrate information across talk-turn sequences (conditional random fields, hidden Markov models, and hierarchical gated recurrent units).Evaluation was performed using cross-validation to measure 1) classification accuracy for talk-turns and 2) precision, recall, and F1 scores at the visit level. Experimental results showed that sequential models had higher classification accuracy at the talk-turn level and higher precision at the visit level. Independent models had higher recall scores at the visit level compared with sequential models.Incorporating sequential information across talk-turns improves the accuracy of topic prediction in patient-provider dialog by smoothing out noisy information from talk-turns. Although the results are promising, more advanced prediction techniques and larger labeled datasets will likely be required to achieve prediction performance appropriate for real-world clinical applications.},

  abstract = {The literature illustrates that technology will widen health disparity if its use is restricted to patients who are already motivated and demonstrate good self-management behaviours. Additionally, despite the availability of free mobile health (m-health) applications for diabetes self-management, usage is low. There are also limited studies of m-health acceptance in South Africa. This research is delineated to the Western Cape, South Africa. The populace suffers from increasing numbers of diabetic patients. Segments of the population also suffer from technological forms of exclusion, such as limited internet access. Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify challenges for user acceptance that discourages the use of m-health applications. This study analysed 130 semi-structured interviews, using thematic content analysis. Respondents were predominantly female with type 2 diabetes, older than 50, residing in the Western Cape. It used key constructs from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. The results confirmed that all four UTAUT constructs; performance expectancy (“the degree to which an individual believes that using the system will help him or her to attain gains in performance”), effort expectancy (“the degree of ease associated with the use of the system”, social influence (“the degree to which an individual perceives that important others believe he or she should use the new system”) and facilitating conditions (“the degree to which an individual believes that an organisational and technical infrastructure exists to support the use of the system”), explains the challenges for m-health acceptance in low socio-economic areas. Factors such as technology anxiety, resistance to change and a lack of trust in the use of devices for self-management need to be considered when implementing future interventions.},

  abstract = {Objectives To assess undergraduate medical students’ attitudes towards artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology and medicine. Materials and methods Aweb-based questionnaire was designed using SurveyMonkey, and was sent out to students at three major medical schools. It consisted of various sections aiming to evaluate the students’ prior knowledge of AI in radiology and beyond, as well as their attitude towards AI in radiology specifically and in medicine in general. Respondents’ anonymity was ensured. Results A total of 263 students (166 female, 94 male, median age 23 years) responded to the questionnaire. Around 52\% were aware of the ongoing discussion about AI in radiology and 68\% stated that they were unaware of the technologies involved. Respondents agreed that AI could potentially detect pathologies in radiological examinations (83\%) but felt that AI would not be able to establish a definite diagnosis (56\%). The majority agreed that AI will revolutionise and improve radiology (77\% and 86\%), while disagreeing with statements that human radiologists will be replaced (83\%). Over two-thirds agreed on the need for AI to be included in medical training (71\%). In sub-group analyses male and tech-savvy respondents were more confident on the benefits of AI and less fearful of these technologies. Conclusion Contrary to anecdotes published in the media, undergraduate medical students do not worry that AI will replace human radiologists, and are aware of the potential applications and implications of AI on radiology and medicine. Radiology should take the lead in educating students about these emerging technologies.},

  abstract = {Objectives Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are diagnosed based on early-manifesting clinical symptoms, including markedly impaired social communication. We assessed the viability of resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) connectivity measures as diagnostic biomarkers for ASD and investigated which connectivity features are predictive of a diagnosis. Methods Rs-fMRI scans from 59 high functioning males with ASD and 59 age- and IQ-matched typically developing (TD) males were used to build a series of machine learning classifiers. Classification features were obtained using 3 sets of brain regions. Another set of classifiers was built from participants' scores on behavioral metrics. An additional age and IQ-matched cohort of 178 individuals (89 ASD; 89 TD) from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) open-access dataset (http://fcon\_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/) were included for replication. Results High classification accuracy was achieved through several rs-fMRI methods (peak accuracy 76.67\%). However, classification via behavioral measures consistently surpassed rs-fMRI classifiers (peak accuracy 95.19\%). The class probability estimates, P(ASD|fMRI data), from brain-based classifiers significantly correlated with scores on a measure of social functioning, the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), as did the most informative features from 2 of the 3 sets of brain-based features. The most informative connections predominantly originated from regions strongly associated with social functioning. Conclusions While individuals can be classified as having ASD with statistically significant accuracy from their rs-fMRI scans alone, this method falls short of biomarker standards. Classification methods provided further evidence that ASD functional connectivity is characterized by dysfunction of large-scale functional networks, particularly those involved in social information processing.},

  abstract = {Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is one of the most effective treatments for severe depression. However, biomarkers that accurately predict a response to ECT remain unidentified.To investigate whether certain factors identified by structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques are able to predict ECT response.In this nonrandomized prospective study, gray matter structure was assessed twice at approximately 6 weeks apart using 3-T MRI and voxel-based morphometry. Patients were recruited through the inpatient service of the Department of Psychiatry, University of Muenster, from March 11, 2010, to March 27, 2015. Two patient groups with acute major depressive disorder were included. One group received an ECT series in addition to antidepressants (n\,=\,24); a comparison sample was treated solely with antidepressants (n\,=\,23). Both groups were compared with a sample of healthy control participants (n\,=\,21). Binary pattern classification was used to predict ECT response by structural MRI that was performed before treatment. In addition, univariate analysis was conducted to predict reduction of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score by pretreatment gray matter volumes and to investigate ECT-related structural changes.One participant in the ECT sample was excluded from the analysis, leaving 67 participants (27 men and 40 women; mean [SD] age, 43.7 [10.6] years). The binary pattern classification yielded a successful prediction of ECT response, with accuracy rates of 78.3\% (18 of 23 patients in the ECT sample) and sensitivity rates of 100\% (13 of 13 who responded to ECT). Furthermore, a support vector regression yielded a significant prediction of relative reduction in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score. The principal findings of the univariate model indicated a positive association between pretreatment subgenual cingulate volume and individual ECT response (Montreal Neurological Institute [MNI] coordinates x\,=\,8, y\,=\,21, z\,=\,−18; Z\,score, 4.00; P\,\&lt;\,.001; peak voxel r\,=\,0.73). Furthermore, the analysis of treatment effects revealed a increase in hippocampal volume in the ECT sample (MNI coordinates x\,=\,−28, y\,=\,−9, z\,=\,−18; Z score, 7.81; P\,\&lt;\,.001) that was missing in the medication-only sample.A relatively small degree of structural impairment in the subgenual cingulate cortex before therapy seems to be associated with successful treatment with ECT. In the future, neuroimaging techniques could prove to be promising tools for predicting the individual therapeutic effectiveness of ECT.}

  abstract = {Several barriers complicate access to psychotherapy for depression, including time commitment, location of services, and stigma. Digital treatment has the potential to address these barriers, yet long term use of digital psychotherapy is poor. This paper presents data from a mixed-methods, online survey to document concerns patients with depression face when given the choice of in-person psychotherapy and digital psychotherapy. Participants were 164 adults living in the United States who had previously used or considered psychotherapy for depression. Rural-dwelling and racial/ethnic minority (Native American, African American, and Spanish-speaking) respondents were purposively sampled. Participants were asked their preferences for and opinions about four treatment modalities: self-guided digital, peer-supported digital, expert-guided digital, or in-person psychotherapy. Less than half (44.5\%) of participants preferred in-person psychotherapy, 25.6\% preferred self-guided digital treatment, 19.7\% preferred expert-guided digital treatment, and 8.5\% peer-supported digital treatment. Principal themes extracted from qualitative analysis centered on the efficacy of digital treatment, access to digital treatment, concerns about peer-supported care, confidentiality and privacy concerns, preference for in-person treatment, skepticism about self-guided therapy, and the impact of social anxiety on the use of video-chat based care. Future development of digital psychotherapy will need to address concerns regarding efficacy, privacy, data security, and methods to enhance motivation to use these treatments.},

Is this transformation a blessing or a curse for psychiatry? To answer this question, we conducted a literature review covering a broad range of new technologies and eHealth services, including telepsychiatry; computer-, internet-, and app-based cognitive behavioral therapy; virtual reality; digital applied games; a digital medicine system; omics; neuroimaging; machine learning; precision psychiatry; clinical decision support; electronic health records; physician charting; digital language translators; and online mental health resources for patients. We found that eHealth services provide effective, scalable, and cost-efficient options for the treatment of people with limited or no access to mental health care. This review highlights innovative technologies spearheading the way to more effective and safer treatments. We identified artificially intelligent tools that relieve physicians from routine tasks, allowing them to focus on collaborative doctor–patient relationships. The transformation of traditional clinics into digital ones is outlined, and the challenges associated with the successful deployment of digitalization in psychiatry are highlighted.},

This study aims to provide a comprehensive review of validated prediction models to estimate the individual risk of being affected with a condition (diagnostic), developing outcomes (prognostic), or responding to treatments (predictive) in mental disorders.                                         Methods               PRISMA/RIGHT/CHARMS-compliant systematic review of the Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Reviews, and Ovid/PsycINFO databases from inception until July 21, 2019 (PROSPERO CRD42019155713) to identify diagnostic/prognostic/predictive prediction studies that reported individualized estimates in psychiatry and that were internally or externally validated or implemented. Random effect meta-regression analyses addressed the impact of several factors on the accuracy of prediction models.                                         Findings               Literature search identified 584 prediction modeling studies, of which 89 were included. 10.4\% of the total studies included prediction models internally validated (n = 61), 4.6\% models externally validated (n = 27), and 0.2\% (n = 1) models considered for implementation. Across validated prediction modeling studies (n = 88), 18.2\% were diagnostic, 68.2\% prognostic, and 13.6\% predictive. The most frequently investigated condition was psychosis (36.4\%), and the most frequently employed predictors clinical (69.5\%). Unimodal compared to multimodal models (β = .29, P = .03) and diagnostic compared to prognostic (β = .84, p \&lt; .0001) and predictive (β = .87, P = .002) models were associated with increased accuracy.                                         Interpretation               To date, several validated prediction models are available to support the diagnosis and prognosis of psychiatric conditions, in particular, psychosis, or to predict treatment response. Advancements of knowledge are limited by the lack of implementation research in real-world clinical practice. A new generation of implementation research is required to address this translational gap.},

Clinicians and health informaticians should become familiar with machine learning and deep learning. Additionally, they should have a strong background in data analytics and data visualization to use, evaluate, and develop AI applications in clinical practice.                                            Objective                The main objective of this study was to evaluate the current state of AI training and the use of AI tools to enhance the learning experience.                                            Methods                A comprehensive systematic review was conducted to analyze the use of AI in medical and health informatics education, and to evaluate existing AI training practices. PRISMA-P (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols) guidelines were followed. The studies that focused on the use of AI tools to enhance medical education and the studies that investigated teaching AI as a new competency were categorized separately to evaluate recent developments.

  abstract = {Background. Digital technologies increasingly shape today’s world of work. This not only affects sectors such as knowledge work and the automotive industry, but also the care sector. On the one hand, many nurses today use technologies supporting some selected and rather peripheral nursing tasks (e.g., electronic documentation). However, on the other hand, more comprehensive and additionally proximal care-related task devices (e.g., diagnostics via telecare) seem to be used less often. From a psychological perspective, attitudes towards technology are an important antecedent of user behaviour. Therefore, in two studies we aimed to examine if nurses’ attitudes towards four digital technology fields (i.e., electronic documentation ED, ambient assisted living AAL, telecare application and robotics) are differing in relation to the type of task substitution, how technology appraisal and knowledge shape these attitudes, and how attitudes predict user behaviour. Method. We conducted two cross-sectional survey studies with German nurses (Study 1: N = 148, Study 2: N = 252) with well-established scales (i.e., general and work-related positive and negative attitudes towards technologies, ease of use, usability, knowledge, and technology use). Results. We found that it is important to consider positive and negative attitudes towards technology distinctively as intercorrelations were only moderately negative. As expected, we found in both studies that nurses reported stronger positive and less negative attitudes towards technologies assumed to be substituting more specific and peripheral (e.g., ED) than comprehensive and proximal care tasks (e.g., robotics). Moreover, we found that two types of technology appraisal (ease of use and usability) both positively correlated with positive attitudes towards all four technology fields, whereas patterns were more inconsistent and additionally influenced by technology knowledge when predicting negative attitudes. Although inconsistently across both studies and the considered technologies, in general, technology users reported more positive and less negative attitudes than non-users. Conclusion. If technology developers and nursing facility managers want to help nurses successfully adopting new technologies in their work routines, nurses’ technology appraisal and technology attitudes have to be considered already in the pre-development phase. Our study results show that nurses report different attitudes towards the four digital technology fields considered here in relation to the levels and types of task-substitution. More specifically, if core carerelated work-tasks (e.g., direct care) are not substituted, nurses report stronger positive and less negative attitudes towards the supporting technologies and higher user behaviour.},

  abstract = {Background and Aims Previous research indicates that motivational interviewing (MI) skills decline over time among participants in training workshops when post-workshop feedback and coaching are not provided. This study explored moderators of skill retention among trainees learning MI mainly for substance use disorder treatment in real-world treatment settings, including workshop enhancements and type and dose of post-workshop feedback and coaching. Methods A meta-analysis of training studies was conducted with studies that reported MI skills using observational measures and that included trainees from real-world agency settings. Standardized change scores were calculated to indicate the magnitude of pre–post training change in MI skills; standardized change scores from post-training to 3 and 6+ months follow-up were calculated to indicate the sustainability of training gains over time. Effect sizes were aggregated using random effects models. Results Twenty-one papers that reported the effects of MI training on agency staff were included in this review. Across studies, training yielded gains in MI skills (d = 0.76). Studies that did not include feedback and/or coaching reported eroding skills over a 6-month follow-up (d = −0.30), whereas post-workshop feedback/coaching sustained skills (d = 0.03). Effects of post-workshop feedback/coaching were moderated by frequency, duration and length of training. Moreover, studies reporting low levels of attrition from training protocols showed small increases in skills over the 6-month follow-up period (d = 0.12), whereas studies with high attrition showed skill erosion (d = −0.29). Conclusions On average, three to four feedback/coaching sessions over a 6-month period sustain skills among trainees for motivational interviewing, mainly for substance use disorder treatment. However, high rates of attrition from feedback/coaching contributes to post-workshop skill erosion.},

Few previous studies have investigated this topic from a multi-disciplinary perspective, including accounting, business and management, decision sciences and health professions.                                            Methods                The structured literature review with its reliable and replicable research protocol allowed the researchers to extract 288 peer-reviewed papers from Scopus. The authors used qualitative and quantitative variables to analyse authors, journals, keywords, and collaboration networks among researchers. Additionally, the paper benefited from the Bibliometrix R software package.                                            Results                The investigation showed that the literature in this field is emerging. It focuses on health services management, predictive medicine, patient data and diagnostics, and clinical decision-making. The United States, China, and the United Kingdom contributed the highest number of studies. Keyword analysis revealed that AI can support physicians in making a diagnosis, predicting the spread of diseases and customising treatment paths.                                            Conclusions                The literature reveals several AI applications for health services and a stream of research that has not fully been covered. For instance, AI projects require skills and data quality awareness for data-intensive analysis and knowledge-based management. Insights can help researchers and health professionals understand and address future research on AI in the healthcare field.},

The authors complement their own work with the experience of 21 machine learning products that address problems across clinical domains and across geographic populations. Four phases of translation emerge: design and develop, evaluate and validate, diffuse and scale, and continuing monitoring and maintenance. The review highlights the varying approaches taken across each phase by teams building machine learning products and presents a discussion of challenges and opportunities. The translational path and associated findings are instructive to researchers and developers building machine learning products, policy makers regulating machine learning products, and health system leaders who are considering adopting a machine learning product.},

In supervised machine learning, a mathematical function is constructed via automated analysis of training data, which consists of input features (such as retinal images) and output labels (such as the grade of macular edema). With large training data sets and minimal human guidance, a computer learns to generalize from the information contained in the training data. The result is a mathematical function, a model, that can be used to map a new record to the corresponding diagnosis, such as an image to grade macular edema. Although machine learning–based models for classification or for predicting a future health state are being developed for diverse clinical applications, evidence is lacking that deployment of these models has improved care and patient outcomes.},

  abstract = {Online peer-to-peer support platforms enable conversations between millions of people who seek and provide mental health support. If successful, web-based mental health conversations could improve access to treatment and reduce the global disease burden. Psychologists have repeatedly demonstrated that empathy, the ability to understand and feel the emotions and experiences of others, is a key component leading to positive outcomes in supportive conversations. However, recent studies have shown that highly empathic conversations are rare in online mental health platforms. In this paper, we work towards improving empathy in online mental health support conversations. We introduce a new task of empathic rewriting which aims to transform low-empathy conversational posts to higher empathy. Learning such transformations is challenging and requires a deep understanding of empathy while maintaining conversation quality through text fluency and specificity to the conversational context. Here we propose Partner, a deep reinforcement learning (RL) agent that learns to make sentence-level edits to posts in order to increase the expressed level of empathy while maintaining conversation quality. Our RL agent leverages a policy network, based on a transformer language model adapted from GPT-2, which performs the dual task of generating candidate empathic sentences and adding those sentences at appropriate positions. During training, we reward transformations that increase empathy in posts while maintaining text fluency, context specificity, and diversity. Through a combination of automatic and human evaluation, we demonstrate that Partner successfully generates more empathic, specific, and diverse responses and outperforms NLP methods from related tasks such as style transfer and empathic dialogue generation. This work has direct implications for facilitating empathic conversations on web-based platforms.},

We show that our Human-AI collaboration approach leads to a 19.60\% increase in conversational empathy between peers overall. Furthermore, we find a larger 38.88\% increase in empathy within the subsample of peer supporters who self-identify as experiencing difficulty providing support. We systematically analyze the Human-AI collaboration patterns and find that peer supporters are able to use the AI feedback both directly and indirectly without becoming overly reliant on AI while reporting improved self-efficacy post-feedback.

  abstract = {BackgroundThis paper aims to synthesise the literature on machine learning (ML) and big data applications for mental health, highlighting current research and applications in practice.MethodsWe employed a scoping review methodology to rapidly map the field of ML in mental health. Eight health and information technology research databases were searched for papers covering this domain. Articles were assessed by two reviewers, and data were extracted on the article's mental health application, ML technique, data type, and study results. Articles were then synthesised via narrative review.ResultsThree hundred papers focusing on the application of ML to mental health were identified. Four main application domains emerged in the literature, including: (i) detection and diagnosis; (ii) prognosis, treatment and support; (iii) public health, and; (iv) research and clinical administration. The most common mental health conditions addressed included depression, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease. ML techniques used included support vector machines, decision trees, neural networks, latent Dirichlet allocation, and clustering.ConclusionsOverall, the application of ML to mental health has demonstrated a range of benefits across the areas of diagnosis, treatment and support, research, and clinical administration. With the majority of studies identified focusing on the detection and diagnosis of mental health conditions, it is evident that there is significant room for the application of ML to other areas of psychology and mental health. The challenges of using ML techniques are discussed, as well as opportunities to improve and advance the field.},

  abstract = {Background: Applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in health care have garnered much attention in recent years, but the implementation issues posed by AI have not been substantially addressed. Objective: In this paper, we have focused on machine learning (ML) as a form of AI and have provided a framework for thinking about use cases of ML in health care. We have structured our discussion of challenges in the implementation of ML in comparison with other technologies using the framework of Nonadoption, Abandonment, and Challenges to the Scale-Up, Spread, and Sustainability of Health and Care Technologies (NASSS). Methods: After providing an overview of AI technology, we describe use cases of ML as falling into the categories of decision support and automation. We suggest these use cases apply to clinical, operational, and epidemiological tasks and that the primary function of ML in health care in the near term will be decision support. We then outline unique implementation issues posed by ML initiatives in the categories addressed by the NASSS framework, specifically including meaningful decision support, explainability, privacy, consent, algorithmic bias, security, scalability, the role of corporations, and the changing nature of health care work. Results: Ultimately, we suggest that the future of ML in health care remains positive but uncertain, as support from patients, the public, and a wide range of health care stakeholders is necessary to enable its meaningful implementation. Conclusions: If the implementation science community is to facilitate the adoption of ML in ways that stand to generate widespread benefits, the issues raised in this paper will require substantial attention in the coming years.},

Participants’ level of knowledge and stigma were recorded through pre- and post-tests using the Mental Health Knowledge Schedule (MAKS), Community Attitudes toward the Mentally Ill (CAMI) and the Opinions about Mental Illness (OMI) scale. Information about mental illness was provided between conditions followed by a distractor task. Responses were calculated and combined to give an overall score. A sign test with continuity correction was used to see whether there was a difference in attitudes. The pre- and post-test conditions were scored. Results demonstrate a statistically significant median decrease in stigma in the post-test condition (p = 0.03).

Herein, we provide an introduction on how machine learning/Artificial Intelligence (AI) may instantiate such capabilities, as well as provide rationale for its application to psychiatry in both research and clinical ecosystems. Methods Databases PubMed and PsycINFO were searched from 1966 to June 2016 for keywords:Big Data, Machine Learning, Precision Medicine, Artificial Intelligence, Mental Health, Mental Disease, Psychiatry, Data Mining, RDoC, and Research Domain Criteria. Articles selected for review were those that were determined to be aligned with the objective of this particular paper. Results Results indicate that AI is a viable option to build useful predictors of outcome while offering objective and comparable accuracy metrics, a unique opportunity, particularly in mental health research. The approach has also consistently brought notable insight into disease models through processing the vast amount of already available multi-domain, semi-structured medical data. The opportunity for AI in psychiatry, in addition to disease-model refinement, is in characterizing those at risk, and it is likely also relevant to personalizing and discovering therapeutics. Conclusions Machine learning currently provides an opportunity to parse disease models in complex, multi-factorial disease states (e.g. mental disorders) and could possibly inform treatment selection with existing therapies and provide bases for domain-based therapeutic discovery.},

  abstract = {Background: The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the medical industry promises many benefits, so AI has been introduced to medical practice primarily in developed countries. In Japan, the government is preparing for the rollout of AI in the medical industry. This rollout depends on doctors and the public accepting the technology. Therefore it is necessary to consider acceptance among doctors and among the public. However, little is known about the acceptance of AI in medicine in Japan. Objective: This study aimed to obtain detailed data on the acceptance of AI in medicine by comparing the acceptance among Japanese doctors with that among the Japanese public. Methods: We conducted an online survey, and the responses of doctors and members of the public were compared. AI in medicine was defined as the use of AI to determine diagnosis and treatment without requiring a doctor. A questionnaire was prepared referred to as the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, a model of behavior toward new technologies. It comprises 20 items, and each item was rated on a five-point scale. Using this questionnaire, we conducted an online survey in 2018 among 399 doctors and 600 members of the public. The sample-wide responses were analyzed, and then the responses of the doctors were compared with those of the public using t tests. Results: Regarding the sample-wide responses (N=999), 653 (65.4\%) of the respondents believed, in the future, AI in medicine would be necessary, whereas only 447 (44.7\%) expressed an intention to use AI-driven medicine. Additionally, 730 (73.1\%) believed that regulatory legislation was necessary, and 734 (73.5\%) were concerned about where accountability lies. Regarding the comparison between doctors and the public, doctors (mean 3.43, SD 1.00) were more likely than members of the public (mean 3.23, SD 0.92) to express intention to use AI-driven medicine (P\&lt;.001), suggesting that optimism about AI in medicine is greater among doctors compared to the public. Conclusions: Many of the respondents were optimistic about the role of AI in medicine. However, when asked whether they would like to use AI-driven medicine, they tended to give a negative response. This trend suggests that concerns about the lack of regulation and about accountability hindered acceptance. Additionally, the results revealed that doctors were more enthusiastic than members of the public regarding AI-driven medicine. For the successful implementation of AI in medicine, it would be necessary to inform the public and doctors about the relevant laws and to take measures to remove their concerns about them.},

  abstract = {Background: Training therapists is both expensive and time-consuming. Degree–based training can require tens of thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours of expert instruction. Counseling skills practice often involves role-plays, standardized patients, or practice with real clients. Performance–based feedback is critical for skill development and expertise, but trainee therapists often receive minimal and subjective feedback, which is distal to their skill practice. Objective: In this study, we developed and evaluated a patient-like neural conversational agent, which provides real-time feedback to trainees via chat–based interaction. Methods: The text–based conversational agent was trained on an archive of 2354 psychotherapy transcripts and provided specific feedback on the use of basic interviewing and counseling skills (ie, open questions and reflections—summary statements of what a client has said). A total of 151 nontherapists were randomized to either (1) immediate feedback on their use of open questions and reflections during practice session with ClientBot or (2) initial education and encouragement on the skills. Results: Participants in the ClientBot condition used 91\% (21.4/11.2) more reflections during practice with feedback (P{$<$}.001) and 76\% (14.1/8) more reflections after feedback was removed (P{$<$}.001) relative to the control group. The treatment group used more open questions during training but not after feedback was removed, suggesting that certain skills may not improve with performance–based feedback. Finally, after feedback was removed, the ClientBot group used 31\% (32.5/24.7) more listening skills overall (P{$<$}.001). Conclusions: This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that practice and feedback can improve trainee use of basic counseling skills.},

  abstract = {Background: Training therapists is both expensive and time-consuming. Degree–based training can require tens of thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours of expert instruction. Counseling skills practice often involves role-plays, standardized patients, or practice with real clients. Performance–based feedback is critical for skill development and expertise, but trainee therapists often receive minimal and subjective feedback, which is distal to their skill practice. Objective: In this study, we developed and evaluated a patient-like neural conversational agent, which provides real-time feedback to trainees via chat–based interaction. Methods: The text–based conversational agent was trained on an archive of 2354 psychotherapy transcripts and provided specific feedback on the use of basic interviewing and counseling skills (ie, open questions and reflections—summary statements of what a client has said). A total of 151 nontherapists were randomized to either (1) immediate feedback on their use of open questions and reflections during practice session with ClientBot or (2) initial education and encouragement on the skills. Results: Participants in the ClientBot condition used 91\% (21.4/11.2) more reflections during practice with feedback (P{$<$}.001) and 76\% (14.1/8) more reflections after feedback was removed (P{$<$}.001) relative to the control group.

  abstract = {High prevalence of mental illness and the need for effective mental health care, combined with recent advances in AI, has led to an increase in explorations of how the field of machine learning (ML) can assist in the detection, diagnosis and treatment of mental health problems. ML techniques can potentially offer new routes for learning patterns of human behavior; identifying mental health symptoms and risk factors; developing predictions about disease progression; and personalizing and optimizing therapies. Despite the potential opportunities for using ML within mental health, this is an emerging research area, and the development of effective ML-enabled applications that are implementable in practice is bound up with an array of complex, interwoven challenges. Aiming to guide future research and identify new directions for advancing development in this important domain, this article presents an introduction to, and a systematic review of, current ML work regarding psycho-socially based mental health conditions from the computing and HCI literature. A quantitative synthesis and qualitative narrative review of 54 papers that were included in the analysis surfaced common trends, gaps, and challenges in this space. Discussing our findings, we (i) reflect on the current state-of-the-art of ML work for mental health, (ii) provide concrete suggestions for a stronger integration of human-centered and multi-disciplinary approaches in research and development, and (iii) invite more consideration of the potentially far-reaching personal, social, and ethical implications that ML models and interventions can have, if they are to find widespread, successful adoption in real-world mental health contexts.},

DL has been widely adopted in image recognition, speech recognition and natural language processing, but is only beginning to impact on healthcare. In ophthalmology, DL has been applied to fundus photographs, optical coherence tomography and visual fields, achieving robust classification performance in the detection of diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity, the glaucoma-like disc, macular oedema and age-related macular degeneration. DL in ocular imaging may be used in conjunction with telemedicine as a possible solution to screen, diagnose and monitor major eye diseases for patients in primary care and community settings. Nonetheless, there are also potential challenges with DL application in ophthalmology, including clinical and technical challenges, explainability of the algorithm results, medicolegal issues, and physician and patient acceptance of the AI ‘black-box’ algorithms. DL could potentially revolutionise how ophthalmology is practised in the future.

Aims To evaluate the effect of automated emails on the effectiveness, safety, and acceptability of a new automated transdiagnostic self-guided internet-delivered treatment, the Wellbeing Course, for people with depression and anxiety. Method A randomised controlled trial was conducted through the website: www.ecentreclinic.org. Two hundred and fifty seven people with elevated symptoms were randomly allocated to the 8 week course either with or without automated emails, or to a waitlist control group. Primary outcome measures were the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-Item (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item (GAD-7). Results Participants in the treatment groups had lower PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores at post-treatment than controls. Automated emails increased rates of course completion (58\% vs. 35\%), and improved outcomes in a subsample with elevated symptoms. Conclusions The new self-guided course was beneficial, and automated emails facilitated outcomes. Further attention to strategies that facilitate adherence, learning, and safety will help realise the potential of self-guided interventions.

  abstract = {Background A recent paper reported the outcomes of a study examining a new self-guided internet-delivered treatment, the Wellbeing Course, for symptoms of anxiety or depression. This study found the intervention resulted in significant symptom reductions. It also found that automated emails increased treatment completion and clinical improvements in a subsample with elevated anxiety and depression. Aims To examine the clinical outcomes and the effect of automated emails at 12 months post-treatment. Method Participants, who were randomly allocated to a Treatment Plus Automated Emails Group (TEG; n = 100), a standard Treatment Group (TG; n = 106) or delayed-treatment Waitlist Control Group (Control; n = 51), were followed up at 12 months post-treatment. Eighty-one percent, 78\% and 87\% of participants in the TEG, TG and treated Waitlist Control Group provided symptom data at 12-month follow-up, respectively. The primary outcome measures were the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item Scale (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Item Scale (GAD-7). Results Significant improvements in symptoms of anxiety and depression were observed over time in both the TEG and TG (Fs {$>$}69, ps {$<$}.001) these were sustained from post-treatment to 12-month follow-up (ps {$>$}.05), and were associated with large effect sizes. No statistically significant differences in symptoms were found between the TEG and TG at post-treatment, 3-month or 12-month follow-up. Previously reported symptom differences between TEG and TG participants with comorbid symptoms were no longer present at 12-month follow-up (ps {$>$}.70). Conclusions The overall benefits of the Wellbeing Course were sustained at 12-month follow-up. Although automated emails facilitated Course completion and reductions in symptoms for participants with comorbid anxiety and depression from pre-post treatment, these differences were no longer observed at 12-month follow-up. The results indicate that automated emails promote more rapid treatment response for people with elevated and comorbid symptoms, but may not improve longer term outcomes.

  abstract = {Background: Applications of natural language processing to mental health notes are not common given the sensitive nature of the associated narratives. The CEGS N-GRID 2016 Shared Task in Clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP) changed this scenario by providing the first set of neuropsychiatric notes to participants. This study summarizes our efforts and results in proposing a novel data use case for this dataset as part of the third track in this shared task. Objective: We explore the feasibility and effectiveness of predicting a set of common mental conditions a patient has based on the short textual description of patient’s history of present illness typically occurring in the beginning of a psychiatric initial evaluation note. Materials and methods: We clean and process the 1000 records made available through the N-GRID clinical NLP task into a key-value dictionary and build a dataset of 986 examples for which there is a narrative for history of present illness as well as Yes/No responses with regards to presence of specific mental conditions. We propose two independent deep neural network models: one based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) and another based on recurrent neural networks with hierarchical attention (ReHAN), the latter of which allows for interpretation of model decisions. We conduct experiments to compare these methods to each other and to baselines based on linear models and named entity recognition (NER). Results: Our CNN model with optimized thresholding of output probability estimates achieves best overall mean micro-F score of 63.144\% for 11 common mental conditions with statistically significant gains (p{$<$}0.05) over all other models. The ReHAN model with interpretable attention mechanism scored 61.904\% mean micro-F1 score. Both models’ improvements over baseline models (support vector machines and NER) are statistically significant. The ReHAN model additionally aids in interpretation of the results by surfacing important words and sentences that lead to a particular prediction for each instance. Conclusions: Although the history of present illness is a short text segment averaging 300 words, it is a good predictor for a few conditions such as anxiety, depression, panic disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Proposed CNN and RNN models outperform baseline approaches and complement each other when evaluating on a per-label basis.},

Studies were included that involved a chatbot in a mental health setting focusing on populations with or at high risk of developing depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, bipolar, and substance abuse disorders.Results:From the selected databases, 1466 records were retrieved and 8 studies met the inclusion criteria. Two additional studies were included from reference list screening for a total of 10 included studies. Overall, potential for conversational agents in psychiatric use was reported to be high across all studies. In particular, conversational agents showed potential for benefit in psychoeducation and self-adherence. In addition, satisfaction rating of chatbots was high across all studies, suggesting that they would be an effective and enjoyable tool in psychiatric treatment.Conclusion:Preliminary evidence for psychiatric use of chatbots is favourable. However, given the heterogeneity of the reviewed studies, further research with standardized outcomes reporting is required to more thoroughly examine the effectiveness of conversational agents. Regardless, early evidence shows that with the proper approach and research, the mental health field could use conversational agents in psychiatric treatment.},

  abstract = {Information technology (IT) acceptance research has yielded many competing models, each with different sets of acceptance determinants. In this paper, we (1) review user acceptance literature and discuss eight prominent models, (2) empirically compare the eight models and their extensions, (3) formulate a unified model that integrates elements across the eight models, and (4) empirically validate the unified model. The eight models reviewed are the theory of reasoned action, the technology acceptance model, the motivational model, the theory of planned behavior, a model combining the technology acceptance model and the theory of planned behavior, the model of PC utilization, the innovation diffusion theory, and the social cognitive theory. Using data from four organizations over a six-month period with three points of measurement, the eight models explained between 17 percent and 53 percent of the variance in user intentions to use information technology. Next, a unified model, called the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), was formulated, with four core determinants of intention and usage, and up to four moderators of key relationships. UTAUT was then tested using the original data and found to outperform the eight individual models (adjusted R of 69 percent). UTAUT was then confirmed with data from two new organizations with similar results (adjusted R of 70 percent). UTAUT thus provides a useful tool for managers needing to assess the likelihood of success for new technology introductions and helps them understand the drivers of acceptance in order to proactively design interventions (including training, marketing, etc.) targeted at populations of users that may be less inclined to adopt and use new systems. The paper also makes several recommendations for future research including developing a deeper understanding of the dynamic influences studied here, refining measurement of the core constructs used in UTAUT, and understanding the organizational outcomes associated with new technology use.}

  abstract = {The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) is a little over a decade old and has been used extensively in information systems (IS) and other fields, as the large number of citations to the original paper that introduced the theory evidences. In this paper, we review and synthesize the IS literature on UTAUT from September 2003 until December 2014, perform a theoretical analysis of UTAUT and its extensions, and chart an agenda for research going forward. Based on Weber’s (2012) framework of theory evaluation, we examined UTAUT and its extensions along two sets of quality dimensions; namely, the parts of a theory and the theory as a whole. While our review identifies many merits to UTAUT, we also found that the progress related to this theory has hampered further theoretical development in research into technology acceptance and use. To chart an agenda for research that will enable significant future work, we analyze the theoretical contributions of UTAUT using Whetten’s (2009) notion of cross-context theorizing. Our analysis reveals several limitations that lead us to propose a multi-level framework that can serve as the theoretical foundation for future research. Specifically, this framework integrates the notion of research context and cross-context theorizing with the theory evaluation framework to: (1) synthesize the existing UTAUT extensions across both the dimensions and the levels of the research context and (2) highlight promising research directions. We conclude with recommendations for future UTAUT-related research using the proposed framework.},

  abstract = {Machine learning (ML) has been introduced into the medical field as a means to provide diagnostic tools capable of enhancing accuracy and precision while minimizing laborious tasks that require human intervention. There is mounting evidence that the technology fueled by ML has the potential to detect and substantially improve treatment of complex mental disorders such as depression. We developed a framework capable of detecting depression with minimal human intervention: artificial intelligence mental evaluation (AiME). This framework consists of a short human-computer interactive evaluation that utilizes artificial intelligence, namely deep learning, and can predict whether the participant is depressed or not with satisfactory performance. Because of its ease of use, this technology can offer a viable tool for mental health professionals to identify symptoms of depression, thus enabling a faster preventative intervention. Furthermore, it may alleviate the challenge of observing and interpreting highly nuanced physiological and behavioral biomarkers of depression by providing a more objective evaluation.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND              New artificial intelligence (AI) tools are being developed at a high speed. However, strategies and practical experiences surrounding the adoption and implementation of AI in health care are lacking. This is likely because of the high implementation complexity of AI, legacy IT infrastructure, and unclear business cases, thus complicating AI adoption. Research has recently started to identify the factors influencing AI readiness of organizations.                                      OBJECTIVE              This study aimed to investigate the factors influencing AI readiness as well as possible barriers to AI adoption and implementation in German hospitals. We also assessed the status quo regarding the dissemination of AI tools in hospitals. We focused on IT decision makers, a seldom studied but highly relevant group.                                      METHODS              We created a web-based survey based on recent AI readiness and implementation literature. Participants were identified through a publicly accessible database and contacted via email or invitational leaflets sent by mail, in some cases accompanied by a telephonic prenotification. The survey responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics.                                      RESULTS              We contacted 609 possible participants, and our database recorded 40 completed surveys. Most participants agreed or rather agreed with the statement that AI would be relevant in the future, both in Germany (37/40, 93\%) and in their own hospital (36/40, 90\%). Participants were asked whether their hospitals used or planned to use AI technologies. Of the 40 participants, 26 (65\%) answered “yes.” Most AI technologies were used or planned for patient care, followed by biomedical research, administration, and logistics and central purchasing. The most important barriers to AI were lack of resources (staff, knowledge, and financial). Relevant possible opportunities for using AI were increase in efficiency owing to time-saving effects, competitive advantages, and increase in quality of care. Most AI tools in use or in planning have been developed with external partners.                                      CONCLUSIONS              Few tools have been implemented in routine care, and many hospitals do not use or plan to use AI in the future. This can likely be explained by missing or unclear business cases or the need for a modern IT infrastructure to integrate AI tools in a usable manner. These shortcomings complicate decision-making and resource attribution. As most AI technologies already in use were developed in cooperation with external partners, these relationships should be fostered. IT decision makers should assess their hospitals’ readiness for AI individually with a focus on resources. Further research should continue to monitor the dissemination of AI tools and readiness factors to determine whether improvements can be made over time. This monitoring is especially important with regard to government-supported investments in AI technologies that could alleviate financial burdens. Qualitative studies with hospital IT decision makers should be conducted to further explore the reasons for slow AI.},

Anxious or trauma-exposed brains are characterized by dysregulated neural activations within regions of this fear network. In this study, we examined how the functional MRI activations of 10 brain regions commonly activated during fear conditioning and extinction might distinguish anxious or trauma-exposed brains from controls. To achieve this, activations during four phases of a fear conditioning and extinction paradigm in 304 participants with or without a psychiatric diagnosis were studied. By training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using task-specific brain activations, we reliably distinguished the anxious and trauma-exposed brains from controls. The performance of models decreased significantly when we trained our CNN using activations from task-irrelevant brain regions or from a brain network that is irrelevant to fear. Our results suggest that neuroimaging data analytics of task-induced brain activations within the fear network might provide novel prospects for development of brain-based psychiatric diagnosis.},

Here, we sought to identify a neurobiological signature of response to antidepressant treatment as compared to placebo. We designed a latent-space machine learning algorithm tailored for resting-state electroencephalography (rsEEG) and applied it to data from the largest imaging-coupled, placebo-controlled antidepressant study (n=309). Symptom improvement was robustly predicted in a manner both specific for the antidepressant sertraline (versus placebo) and generalizable across different study sites and EEG equipment. This sertraline-predictive EEG signature generalized to two depression samples, wherein it reflected general antidepressant medication responsivity, and related differentially to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) treatment outcome. Furthermore, we found that the sertraline rsEEG signature indexed prefrontal neural responsivity, as measured by concurrent TMS/EEG. Our findings advance the neurobiological understanding of antidepressant treatment through an EEG-tailored computational model and provide a clinical avenue for personalized treatment of depression.},

Now clinic diagnosis of ASD is mostly based on psychological evaluation, clinical observation and medical history. All these behavioral indexes could not avoid defects such as subjectivity and reporter-dependency. Therefore researchers devoted themselves to seek relatively stable biomarkers of ASD as supplementary diagnostic evidence. The goal of present study is to generate relatively stable predictive model based on anatomical brain features by using machine learning technique. Forty-six ASD children and thirty-nine development delay children aged from 18 to 37 months were evolved in. As a result, the predictive model generated by regional average cortical thickness of regions with top 20 highest importance of random forest classifier showed best diagnostic performance. And random forest was proved to be the optimal approach for neuroimaging data mining in small size set and thickness-based classification outperformed volume-based classification and surface area-based classification in ASD. The brain regions selected by the models might attract attention and the idea of considering biomarkers as a supplementary evidence of ASD diagnosis worth exploring.

It is labor-intensive, error prone, and expensive, limiting its use in evaluating psychotherapy in the real world. Engineering solutions from speech and language processing provide new methods for the automatic evaluation of provider ratings from session recordings. The primary data are 200 Motivational Interviewing (MI) sessions from a study on MI training methods with observer ratings of counselor empathy. Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) was used to transcribe sessions, and the resulting words were used in a text-based predictive model of empathy. Two supporting datasets trained the speech processing tasks including ASR (1200 transcripts from heterogeneous psychotherapy sessions and 153 transcripts and session recordings from 5 MI clinical trials). The accuracy of computationally-derived empathy ratings were evaluated against human ratings for each provider. Computationally-derived empathy scores and classifications (high vs. low) were highly accurate against human-based codes and classifications, with a correlation of 0.65 and F-score (a weighted average of sensitivity and specificity) of 0.86, respectively. Empathy prediction using human transcription as input (as opposed to ASR) resulted in a slight increase in prediction accuracies, suggesting that the fully automatic system with ASR is relatively robust. Using speech and language processing methods, it is possible to generate accurate predictions of provider performance in psychotherapy from audio recordings alone. This technology can support large-scale evaluation of psychotherapy for dissemination and process studies.},

  abstract = {Screening and timely diagnosis of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are currently an important challenge in studies of children’s ethology for increasing community mental health. Nevertheless, most studies on ADHD employed self-report questionnaires in which the reliability is questionable. A few of the studies for diagnosing the ADHD, which used the EEG signals, was not able to enhance the accuracy due to the use of stand-alone classifiers. Therefore, in this paper, we provided a novel analysis framework by combining a set of fuzzy inference system (FIS), called the mixture of expert fuzzy models (MEFM), which have high potential for diagnosing the ADHD children. Within this framework, we developed the MEFM utilizing features extracted from the continuous wavelet transform scalograms of EEG signals obtained from five different channels (Fz, Cz, Pz, C3 and C4). Then, we tuned the internal parameters of the MEFM employing the genetic algorithm. We, also, evaluated the MEFM classifier applying the tenfold cross-validation method and compared this classifier with stand-alone FIS and support vector machine (SVM). Experimental results of MEFM classifier due to collective decision-making of the gating network exhibited a significant improvement (99.01\% accuracy) compare to stand-alone classifiers (98.07, 97.81\% and 88.25 for RBF-SVM, stand-alone fuzzy inference system (SFIS), linear-SVM). These results also illustrate that the MEFM classifier (due to distributed structure in comparison with the SFIS classifier) extremely reduced the number of fuzzy rules. Therefore, this new fuzzy combination (among the classifiers developed by several EEG channel) not only is a novelty in the fuzzy theory, but also considers being a better alternative for identifying and screening children with ADHD.},

  abstract = {Although autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a serious lifelong condition, its underlying neural mechanism remains unclear. Recently, neuroimaging-based classifiers for ASD and typically developed (TD) individuals were developed to identify the abnormality of functional connections (FCs). Due to over-fitting and interferential effects of varying measurement conditions and demographic distributions, no classifiers have been strictly validated for independent cohorts. Here we overcome these difficulties by developing a novel machine-learning algorithm that identifies a small number of FCs that separates ASD versus TD. The classifier achieves high accuracy for a Japanese discovery cohort and demonstrates a remarkable degree of generalization for two independent validation cohorts in the USA and Japan. The developed ASD classifier does not distinguish individuals with major depressive disorder and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder from their controls but moderately distinguishes patients with schizophrenia from their controls. The results leave open the viable possibility of exploring neuroimaging-based dimensions quantifying the multiple-disorder spectrum.},

  abstract = {Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) applications are growing at an unprecedented pace in health care, including disease diagnosis, triage or screening, risk analysis, surgical operations, and so forth. Despite a great deal of research in the development and validation of health care AI, only few applications have been actually implemented at the frontlines of clinical practice. Objective: The objective of this study was to systematically review AI applications that have been implemented in real-life clinical practice. Methods: We conducted a literature search in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central, and CINAHL to identify relevant articles published between January 2010 and May 2020. We also hand searched premier computer science journals and conferences as well as registered clinical trials. Studies were included if they reported AI applications that had been implemented in real-world clinical settings. Results: We identified 51 relevant studies that reported the implementation and evaluation of AI applications in clinical practice, of which 13 adopted a randomized controlled trial design and eight adopted an experimental design. The AI applications targeted various clinical tasks, such as screening or triage (n=16), disease diagnosis (n=16), risk analysis (n=14), and treatment (n=7). The most commonly addressed diseases and conditions were sepsis (n=6), breast cancer (n=5), diabetic retinopathy (n=4), and polyp and adenoma (n=4). Regarding the evaluation outcomes, we found that 26 studies examined the performance of AI applications in clinical settings, 33 studies examined the effect of AI applications on clinician outcomes, 14 studies examined the effect on patient outcomes, and one study examined the economic impact associated with AI implementation. Conclusions: This review indicates that research on the clinical implementation of AI applications is still at an early stage despite the great potential. More research needs to assess the benefits and challenges associated with clinical AI applications through a more rigorous methodology.},

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the attitudes and perceptions of Turkish dental students towards AI and to provide information about their opinions to use of AI in dentistry. Methods A 22-question survey was distributed through Google Forms to all dental students at 9 Turkish dental schools in March 2019. It consisted of various sections aiming to evaluate the dental students’ knowledge and attitudes toward AI and possible applications in dentistry. Respondents’ anonymity was ensured. Results A total of 1103 students (650 female, 453 male; mean age was 21.36 ± 1.93 years) responded to the questionnaire for a 21.69\% response rate. Of these, about 48.40\% had basic knowledge about AI technologies and 10.6\% stated that they had no information sources about AI. 85.70\% agreed that dentistry would be revolutionized by AI but 28.60\% did not agree that AI could replace themselves in the near future. In addition, 74.60\% and 79.80\% of agreed on topics about AI to be included in undergraduate and postgraduate dental education, respectively. Conclusions Although participants have insufficient knowledge of AI, they are willing to improve their knowledge in this field. Participants shared an optimistic views and thought that AI will have a positive impact on dental future practice. Follow-up surveys and multinational studies should be conducted to further explore these issues.},

  abstract = {Background: An artificial intelligence (AI)–assisted contouring system benefits radiation oncologists by saving time and improving treatment accuracy. Yet, there is much hope and fear surrounding such technologies, and this fear can manifest as resistance from health care professionals, which can lead to the failure of AI projects. Objective: The objective of this study was to develop and test a model for investigating the factors that drive radiation oncologists’ acceptance of AI contouring technology in a Chinese context. Methods: A model of AI-assisted contouring technology acceptance was developed based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model by adding the variables of perceived risk and resistance that were proposed in this study. The model included 8 constructs with 29 questionnaire items. A total of 307 respondents completed the questionnaires. Structural equation modeling was conducted to evaluate the model’s path effects, significance, and fitness. Results: The overall fitness indices for the model were evaluated and showed that the model was a good fit to the data. Behavioral intention was significantly affected by performance expectancy (β=.155; P=.01), social influence (β=.365; P\&lt;.001), and facilitating conditions (β=.459; P\&lt;.001). Effort expectancy (β=.055; P=.45), perceived risk (β=−.048; P=.35), and resistance bias (β=−.020; P=.63) did not significantly affect behavioral intention. Conclusions: The physicians’ overall perceptions of an AI-assisted technology for radiation contouring were high. Technology resistance among Chinese radiation oncologists was low and not related to behavioral intention. Not all of the factors in the Venkatesh UTAUT model applied to AI technology adoption among physicians in a Chinese context.},

Here, we report the identification of two clinically relevant subtypes of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) on the basis of robust and distinct functional-connectivity patterns, prominently within the frontoparietal-control and default-mode networks. We identified the disease subtypes by analysing, via unsupervised and supervised machine learning, the power-envelope-based connectivity of signals reconstructed from high-density resting-state electroencephalography in four datasets from patients with PTSD and MDD, and show that the subtypes are transferable across independent datasets recorded under different conditions. The subtype whose functional connectivity differed most from those of healthy controls was less responsive to psychotherapy treatment for PTSD and failed to respond to an antidepressant medication for MDD. By contrast, both subtypes responded equally well to two different forms of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy for MDD. Our data-driven approach may constitute a generalizable solution for connectome-based diagnosis., The analysis of functional-connectivity patterns in resting-state electroencephalography data via machine learning led to the identification of two clinically relevant subtypes of post-traumatic stress disorder and major depressive disorder.},

With the widespread adoption of social media and mobile devices, and rapid advances in artificial intelligence, a unique opportunity arises for tackling mental health problems. In this study, we investigate how users’ online social activities and physiological signals detected through ubiquitous sensors can be utilized in realistic scenarios for monitoring their mental health states. First, we extract a suite of multimodal time-series signals using modern computer vision and signal processing techniques, from recruited participants while they are immersed in online social media that elicit emotions and emotion transitions. Next, we use machine learning techniques to build a model that establishes the connection between mental states and the extracted multimodal signals. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our approach using two groups of recruited subjects.},

This model consists of two parts, a classifier and an intuitive representation of discriminative pattern of brain function between patients and normal controls. Regional homogeneity (ReHo), a measure of brain function at resting-state, is used here as a feature of classification. Fisher discriminative analysis (FDA) is performed on the features of training samples and a linear classifier is generated. Our initial experimental results show a successful classification rate of 85\%, using leave-one-out cross validation. The classifier is also compared with linear support vector machine (SVM) and Batch Perceptron. Our classifier outperforms the alternatives significantly. Fisher brain, the optimal projective-direction vector in FDA, is used to represent the discriminative pattern. Some abnormal brain regions identified by Fisher brain, like prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, are well consistent with that reported in neuroimaging studies on ADHD. Moreover, some less reported but highly discriminative regions are also identified. We conclude that the discriminative model has potential ability to improve current diagnosis and treatment evaluation of ADHD.},

  abstract = {Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common mental health disorders. As a neuro development disorder, neuroimaging technologies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), coupled with machine learning algorithms, are being increasingly explored as biomarkers in ADHD. Among various machine learning methods, deep learning has demonstrated excellent performance on many imaging tasks. With the availability of publically-available, large neuroimaging data sets for training purposes, deep learning-based automatic diagnosis of psychiatric disorders can become feasible. In this paper, we develop a deep learning-based ADHD classification method via 3-D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) applied to MRI scans. Since deep neural networks may utilize millions of parameters, even the large number of MRI samples in pooled data sets is still relatively limited if one is to learn discriminative features from the raw data. Instead, here we propose to first extract meaningful 3-D low-level features from functional MRI (fMRI) and structural MRI (sMRI) data. Furthermore, inspired by radiologists' typical approach for examining brain images, we design a 3-D CNN model to investigate the local spatial patterns of MRI features. Finally, we discover that brain functional and structural information are complementary, and design a multi-modality CNN architecture to combine fMRI and sMRI features. Evaluations on the hold-out testing data of the ADHD-200 global competition shows that the proposed multi-modality 3-D CNN approach achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy of 69.15\% and outperforms reported classifiers in the literature, even with fewer training samples. We suggest that multi-modality classification will be a promising direction to find potential neuroimaging biomarkers of neuro development disorders.},
